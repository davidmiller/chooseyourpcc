I am a senior barrister specialising in criminal law for over 25 years.
Over the last 4 years I have seen the devastating effect upon front line police officers of the government’s cuts and consequential changes in operation.
This includes experience of the inadequate investigations criticised by others. I am totally independent of the police.
My principles are informed by my life-long membership of the Labour Party but my legal background means I am independent-minded.
Police officers’ morale in the Avon & Somerset Constabulary is very low. Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary has judged that the force “requires improvement”.
The latest serious case review criticises the quality of investigations into child sexual exploitation. Violent crime is on the increase. Sexual assaults and incidents of domestic violence have also gone up significantly.
People feel that the centralisation of police resources has removed policing from them.
After 4 chief constables in fewer than 4 years the police need stability and leadership. Priorities have to be changed to produce better policing with better use of experience and resources. The specialist teams disbanded over recent years should be brought back into operation.
My pledges are clear:

More officers on the beat – in rural communities, towns, on estates and in the inner cities
Officers who know their community and where people know them
Better technology – to allow police officers to work where they are (instead of having to return to the ever dwindling number of police stations)
Body cameras for all police officers
The reinstatement of specialist teams – to deal with child abuse, sex offences and domestic violence

Inequality, substance misuse, mental health issues, school exclusions. We need to address those.
We need to tackle violence against children including sexual exploitation. Every child matters and that includes ‘Looked After’ kids.
We also need to tackle violence against women, including domestic violence, rape and sexual abuse.
And imagine a serious debate about drug reform and decriminalisation. Wouldn’t that be something!
Public trust and confidence in the police needs to improve. If they can protect children from harm, protect women from abuse, and deal sensibly with substance misusers, our communities will then be much safer places in which to live.

My top priorities to make us safe:

Safeguard frontline policing
Cut re-offending
Improve detection rates and provide closure for victims

Police officers have a tough job and need more support. We need to free up the police to spend less time with bureaucracy and in offices and have more time in our communities. A significant amount of police time is taken up with people with mental health issues who need other help. We all need to work together to ensure anyone experiencing a mental health crisis is not caught up in the criminal system. We must allow our police to concentrate on solving and stopping crime.
I’ll also make sure we do more to cut re-offending.
Focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice cuts crime, saves police time and taxpayers’ money.
In addition, more needs to be done to stop people becoming criminals in the first place. We need to identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults before they fall into a life of crime.
I have been the Leader of Bath and North East Somerset Council for 9 years and understand how to ensure large public bodies and other agencies work together in the most effective way. As a Councillor for 25 years I know what it takes to keep people on the straight and narrow.
I’ll use that experience to ensure we’re doing all we can to tackle the causes of crime in our communities.
With your support on May 5th I’ll make sure we have an effective and focussed police force that will help keep you, your family and local community safe.

As an independent I’m determined that party politics have no place in policing. The Police are there to keep us safe. The Police belong to you, not to political ideologies, nor career politicians.
I will continue to protect residents and Police from political interference, without fear or favour – answerable only to residents of Avon and Somerset.
Policing is complex. Being your PCC for over 3 years, leading a major local business, plus years as a magistrate, uniquely qualify me to provide managerial skills and leadership to deliver the Police Service we all deserve.
Government cuts of £60m meant fewer police officers – with further savings to come. Wise prioritisation, partnerships and technology is the way forward.
With the Chief Constable, tackling the rise of crimes against our most vulnerable will be a priority.
If you choose me to be your PCC again, I shall continue to:

Protect residents and police from political interference. Keeping Politics out of Policing
Prevent crime so you can be safe and feel safe
Listen and be your voice: working with the Chief Constable for better policing
Champion Police Officers, PCSO’s and Special Constables in your Neighbourhood
Be a fierce advocate for victims 
Work with partners to make justice more accessible, faster, simpler
Ensure your money is spent efficiently, effectively, wisely

MAKING A DIFFERENCE SINCE 2012
*Over 25,000 victims supported by Lighthouse. *Anti-social behaviour reduced. *Reporting of domestic and sexual violent crimes increased by 50% reflecting more confidence. *All-time low in burglaries in 2014 with increased crime prevention. *Road safety: more investment in education and enforcement resulting in fewer killed/seriously injured.

Honesty, Integrity, Openness and Fairness 
These, the principles that have stood by me, underlined the 26 years of my Policing career which I have served the residents of Avon and Somerset as a Police Officer.
I am fiercely proud of the Independent role of the Police and have always been passionate about Avon and Somerset Constabulary and its ability to deliver the best possible service to the residents of the area.
Avon and Somerset Constabulary has gone through a difficult period over the last few years. I want to change that, to be the person that can rebuild the reputation and service delivery in partnership with the new Chief Constable.
I will Prioritise:-

Putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system, ensuring working in partnership the needs of the victims are prioritised.
Re-focus and Re-assess the needs of Neighbourhood Policing, listen to what you are saying and embed policing back into the communities.
Protect the people that protect us, be the PCC that increases the number of police officers and PCSO’s year on year to be able to deliver the visible service we all want.
Deal with traditional and modern day crimes robustly and effectively, making best use of the criminal justice system to achieve the right outcomes.
Deliver value for money, making sure that the budgets available are spent in the right places to deliver the service you should rightly deserve.

As a Councillor from a ward with historic crime problems I know how effective it is when Police get out of their patrol cars and engage with the community.
Since 2009, thanks to this approach, anti-social behaviour is down nearly 75%. Visible, community based policing helps prevent crime, cuts reoffending and reassures the public.
As my grandmother would say – ‘Prevention is better than cure’.
Over the last three years police numbers have fallen, Police Stations have closed, yet the PR team has grown by a quarter and the office of the PCC now costs £100k more than the previous Police Authority.
The current priorities are wrong. We must protect the front line, not inflate the back office.
With your support I vow to put the community first.
My priorities are:

Putting the community at the heart of Policing

I believe in Community policing with a strong, visible presence on our streets.

Devolve and empower local policing 

The Force area is too large to adopt a ‘one size fits all approach’.

Reducing Re-offending

I will work with the Crown Prosecution Service and Courts to speed up justice to get criminals off our streets and before the courts.

Greater support for victims of crime

Make better use of new victim support methods, such as restorative justice, to provide a victim-led system of support.

Reducing Rural Crime is a priority 

I will prioritise combatting rural crime. We must tackle the perception that this is an afterthought.

Tackling anti-social behaviour and drug crime 

We need to ensure that local residents and the Police are working together to tackle these problems robustly.

I am not satisfied that this is the case at present, with politically correct non-crimes investigated and resources wasted.
I am particularly concerned about the rise of extremism and the threat of terrorism. Tough action must be taken against the perpetrators.
I am passionate about ending the activities of child grooming gangs. There must be zero tolerance with vulnerable youngsters encouraged to come forward in safety.
I support traditional policing methods and engagement with the people of Bedfordshire:

to build trust and confidence;
through more local and visible policing; and
with more Special Constables recruited to work in their communities.

Bedfordshire Police is underfunded. I will work in partnership with private business to raise more funding. However our money must be targeted more efficiently.
Hundreds of thousands of pounds have previously been wasted on exit packages for staff members. I will ensure that every single possible penny in the police budget is spent on front-line services to provide for as many police officers as possible.
We have several major destinations within Bedfordshire such as Luton Airport, Luton Town, Woburn Safari Park, Whipsnade Zoo and the Motorway network. Millions come to Bedfordshire and rely on our Police. We must harness these visitors to assist in petitioning Government and with cross party support from our local MPs, we can energetically successfully lobby for more funding.
I will be able to do this through partnership and agreement rather than by stirring up inter-party rivalries.
Toni Bugle as Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner means:

Fairer traditional policing
Protection for the vulnerable
Action against child grooming gangs
Safer streets
Better funding and more police

I spent 20 years as a news reporter and presenter for services like ITN, TV-am and Sky, getting to the truth of the matter and holding the authorities to account on behalf of the public which I believe are essential skills as a Police and Crime Commissioner. I also covered every possible stage of the Criminal Justice system from close up, working alongside detectives and covering cases from Magistrates’ Courts to the Old Bailey. Since 2000 I have built an international reputation as a specialist in the release of public information in an emergency. I worked for 8 years for the Cabinet Office’s National Emergency Planning College and have advised Chief Constables, Fire Chiefs, military leaders and the boards of some of Britain’s largest companies in a crisis, as well as speaking at the World Conference in Disaster Management. This background means I will explain police action to the public and could never preside over a cover-up.
I will introduce practical, common-sense solutions to work with our budget of £100 million and to use our officers to best effect. I will work with partners like the NHS, Fire Service and councils to share facilities where possible and support one another so the police do take on the responsibilities of others. I do not need an expensive Deputy or PR Agency.
I will make sure that you get a fair share of policing whether you live in the town or country and whichever community you belong to as a Commissioner for all.

In this local election, we need a Police and Crime Commissioner who will speak up for Bedfordshire, fight for proper funding and work to ensure that our police are given the resources and support to do their jobs. I have a track record of representing others and a reputation for fighting on their behalf; I will be that strong voice Bedfordshire needs.
I have spent my life in public service, serving as an analyst in military intelligence, teaching in Luton and Harlington and working as a youth worker and senior manager across the county, working closely with our diverse communities. I served as a local councillor in Bedford and as Unison Branch Secretary for the county. I then worked as Youth Policy Adviser for the Financial Services Authority, working closely with government, local authorities and leading voluntary sector organisations. My strength is in bringing communities and organisations together to the benefit of all, which is why I am committed to working collaboratively with local councils, the NHS and other public and voluntary services to make Bedfordshire a safer place for us all to live and work.
Prevention is always better than cure. Preventing crime, reducing reoffending and empowering victims by giving them a voice in the justice system is my first priority and I will follow an evidence-based approach to prevent crime, particularly violent crime, hate crime and domestic violence which ruins lives.
Nothing is more important for the state to do than protect its citizens. My commitment to you is to work tirelessly to do just that.

Both of these forces are better funded and have many more police. This scandalous situation occurs because our police are funded by government as though we are a rural constabulary, ignoring the urban challenges faced by our ‘thin blue line’. Incredibly, government funding cuts mean police strength here has gone down rather than up since 2010.
The Chief Constable says we need at least 300 extra officers to police Bedfordshire adequately, PCs that would enable the force to have proper community policing in each part of the county. This is not possible with the existing incredibly low level of police. That’s why my top priority is fighting for fairer government police funding.
My next priority is ensuring we nonetheless make the best possible use of the resources we do have. Better use of technology, volunteering and joint working with other police forces and the public sector, are all playing an important role in keeping our county safe. I will continue to work hard on such initiatives to protect front line policing strength.
Burglary and robbery are down during my tenure, whilst victim satisfaction is up, emergency response has improved, and reporting of ‘hidden harms’ such as domestic abuse, hate crimes and sexual offences have increased as victim confidence has risen. This is a remarkable testament to the dedication of our police and why my commitment is that I will not rest until the force is adequately funded.

There is a real need for change that prioritises putting more officers on the street, deals with alcohol related and domestic violence, child sexual exploitation, human trafficking and low-level crime.
These are not just words. I will help those affected by crime and fear of crime. I’ll promote safer neighbourhoods by bringing senior police officers to meet our communities and set priorities. Then these will become my priorities for the police to achieve.
I will be a pro-active Commissioner – available 24/7, supporting our police to grow into a more dynamic, forward-looking service that is more accountable, transparent and responsive to local people.
I have a lifetime of public service – over 30 years as a firefighter, then at Anglia Ruskin University writing their public service degree, lecturing on policing and more recently as a Councillor.
I stand for a police service that the residents of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough deserve. Not a service that since 2010 has been cut and privatised.
My policy of improving communications between the police and local people will be centre stage of my pledge to build confidence in the police, promote community safety, reduce crime and antisocial behaviour.
I can only achieve this if you give me your mandate on the 5th May. Then l can make it happen.

It is time to take the fight to the criminals. The interests of law abiding citizens and victims must take precedence over those of the criminals.
We must proactively go after those that make our lives a misery. I want Cambridgeshire to be the most criminal unfriendly county in this country.
I am impatient of unnecessary bureaucracy and expect public services to run efficiently and in the interests of the people they serve.
Illegal drug supply must be tackled head on. Turning a blind eye to drug use sends the wrong message to our young people.
Speeding, rural crime and anti-social behavior cause misery and must be tackled.
Political correctness must go. Our officers must have the confidence to do the right thing and then be supported.
The 101 phone answering service must be better or crimes won’t be reported.
I will cut the cost of the Commissioners office, including not having a deputy and reviewing staff costs and numbers, and spend it on the frontline.
I want more public engagement and transparency. I want a more flexible approach to questions from the public at meetings, more public consultations and greater involvement of elected councillors in determining local priorities. Where ever possible meetings will be held in public.
I served in the RAF, have run companies and been an independent member of Cambridgeshire’s Police Authority.
As Leader of Cambridgeshire County Council I drove through radical changes to the organization improving efficiency whilst protecting frontline services.

Other parties focus on arrests and enforcement. I will focus on reducing crime in the first place. We can cut crime more effectively by doing what consistent research evidence shows works best. I will therefore put more resources into:

preventing first-time offenders from going on to reoffend;
helping recently-released prisoners who want to go straight and stay out of trouble;
focusing attention on offenders who don’t want to give up their life of crime.

 
Working with first-time offenders is the most effective approach. Proven techniques, such as restorative justice which forces offenders to confront the impact of their crimes, can turn many more people away from crime for good. Research evidence shows this works best if done by uniformed police officers.
 
Accessible and effective
As your Police & Crime Commissioner, I will

ensure the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough force becomes a leader in best practice and effectiveness so we all benefit;
strengthen trust in the police by increasing openness and transparency;
set policing priorities for each urban and rural area locally and in public, with the involvement of the community and its leaders;
protect the principles of neighbourhood and community policing.

 
I grew up in the Fens, have lived and worked in Cambridge, and now live in Queen Adelaide near Ely, so I understand the different police and crime issues across Cambridgeshire, essential knowledge for being Commissioner.
 
I am a policing and security professional. I helped establish the National Centre for Policing Excellence, and consider it a privilege to work with the police services, alongside enthusiastic and dedicated staff.
 
Being Police & Crime Commissioner is a more than full-time job. If elected as your Commissioner I will undertake no other employment.

Under my leadership, using my background in policing and public service – I am a former Assistant Chief Constable for Cheshire – I believe I have delivered on my promises.
We’ve seen overall crime fall to its lowest level since the 1990s with police recorded burglaries down by 19% in the last year alone. We’ve committed to more police on the streets with 2,053 frontline officers by 2017. And we’ve undertaken a far-reaching review to get value for money whilst investing in technology to put boots on the ground, not stuck behind desks.
My pledge remains simple. I want to make Cheshire the safest county in the country for its decent, hardworking, law-abiding citizens but I also want it to be the most hostile county in the country for those intent on committing crime.
My Plan for Cheshire includes:

More visible front-line police officers – 2,053 by March 2017
Enhancing community policing – officers and PCSOs where you need them most
Ensuring every penny of taxpayers’ money is spent wisely
Giving officers the tools and technology they need to solve crimes
Developing support for victims through the Cheshire CARES service

Further details are set out in my manifesto at www.johndwyer.org.uk
I’m proud that Cheshire Constabulary has been judged, independently, as ‘Outstanding’; one of the best performing in the country. I’m determined to build on this ‘Top 3’ status for Cheshire in the years ahead, continuing to use my skills to manage the £192.5m police budget and deliver the safest possible county for everyone.

If something bad happens we want a quick response, a reassuring presence and confidence that action will be taken. This requires a strong and committed police service.
We have 18,000 fewer Police Officers now than when the Conservatives came to government in 2010 and as I listen to local families there’s a clear consensus that these cuts threaten our safety and security. I’m determined to send that message back to the government.
We all now know that Crime hasn’t really fallen over this period, but it has changed. It’s estimated that for every recorded crime there are an additional two unrecorded ‘cyber-crimes’. Is there really a difference whether you have lost £500 to an on-street ‘pick-pocket’ or to a cyber-criminal online? Policing needs to evolve be equally effective in both cases.
Recorded crime has changed too, it’s become more violent and anti-social. Reports of violence against the person, possession of weapons and public order offences increased by almost 20% in Cheshire alone last year.
So I say let’s focus on cutting crime, not the Police. I pledge delivery of real neighbourhood policing. I pledge to back our officers and get them back on the streets – fighting crime and keeping us safe. I pledge to focus on the delivery of your priorities and a police service you will be proud of. I’m listening and reacting every day to the experiences of ordinary families throughout Cheshire. Please visit my website to find out more and tell me your views.

It has not!
Simply, abusers have gone behind closed doors, scammers and groomers have moved online and criminals have globalised.
The challenge is great, our children, our young people, our bank accounts, our pensions, our businesses, our parents and grandparents are all at risk.
I will:

Launch a community led awareness campaign to ‘lock our digital doors’ and keep our kids safe – #CyberSafeCheshire
Stand for cybersafe community led policing and work with teachers, schools, local government, social services, fire service, health and mental health services, 3rd sector charities and organisations from Barnardos and NSPCC to Age UK and faith and volunteer organisations too
Create a dedicated cybercrime unit to tackle digital crime and support local business

More For Our Money!
The Tory government will cut £5m from Cheshire Police in the next four years. Despite this challenge, I will:

Increase police ‘feet on the beat’
Stop the waste of police time resources (e.g. ‘clocking on’ at distant stations)
Use technology and data to better police rural and urban road risks
Prioritise crime prevention

Protect Those That Need Help
I will work to protect the vulnerable, to ensure that victims are effectively supported and witnesses are encouraged to come forward.

I am an entrepreneur who has spent a lifetime solving technical and people based challenges. I’m a resident of Cheshire, and will represent the interests of residents to the police, holding the police to account whilst praising good performance.

I am a composer and virtuoso pianist and my music is distributed by Sony ATV, Amphonic and Universal and is utilised by the broadcast industries of 54 countries.
Whilst I have no professional connections with the legal or law enforcement agencies, I was a Councillor on the former Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council and Governor of three local schools for many years. In this respect, I have an advantage as I understand people’s concerns but do not have any preconceptions, expectations or ‘baggage’ that would prevent or inhibit my thinking regarding the implementation of democratic impartial policing strategies.
I view the role of Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) as reflecting the priorities and concerns of the residents of Cheshire, both town and rural communities, negating the poor perception of safety and working against all the challenges and government cuts to make safety a reality. The police are also PCC constituents and their views are also important. Cutting bureaucracy, reducing target/quota driven policing, consistently monitoring efficiency savings and investing in new technologies would greatly improve morale amongst our hard working officers.
Voting for a UKIP candidate is a vote for someone whose ethos and belief is in democracy, accessibility and accountability. The older parties are burdened with decades of indefensible ideology and policy of which we are neither obligated to, nor inclined to support, we value commonsense.
I can deliver an impartial democratically minded PCC that Cheshire deserves with an abundance of ambition to make Cheshire the safest and best policed area in the country.
Vote for commonsense.

With 28 years knowledge of the police service and criminal justice system, I have what it takes to lead change in Cleveland Police, “ Better policing for a safer Cleveland. “ Only the right leadership, with passion and commitment, can drive change.
HMIC’s latest assessment puts Cleveland in the bottom 3 of all 43 police forces, in all areas of assessment:

Keeping people safe and reducing crime – Requires Improvement
Managing budgets & meeting service demand – Requires Improvement
Conforming to the law  – Requires Improvement

HMIC [25th Feb 2016]: “I have some serious concerns about the performance of Cleveland Police in keeping people safe and reducing crime, and how prepared it is to meet future financial challenges.
Officer numbers are down. Crime is soaring.

6457 more victims of crime compared to last year
177 fewer officers on our streets than 3 years ago
£28.85m a year is going to private companies
9 police stations being closed to the public
Seemingly never-ending scandals

My straightforward plan to deliver real improvements and better policing for a safer Cleveland:

More “ Bobbies on the beat. ”  At Least 130 More officers on our streets = less crime.
Protecting Victims and Witnesses – immediate steps to correctly identify vulnerable victims and integrate safeguarding systems.
Terminate private contracts that fail to deliver value and quality of service.
Better policing standards by strict enforcement of the Police Code of Ethics.
Ensure as many stations as possible remain open to the public

No politics no excuses, just “ better policing “

Cleveland Police face extremely challenging financial circumstances. In the past six years we have seen a real term cut of £36m (33%) in Government grants resulting in the loss of 400 posts.
For some forces the answer to financial pressures has been to vastly reduce Neighbourhood Policing. I am pleased to say that, following considerable work by my Office and the Chief Constable, Neighbourhood Policing is being retained in Cleveland.
I will continue to fight against Government cuts to policing and will continue to have as my priorities the protection of the vulnerable and the strengthening of Neighbourhood Policing. I welcome collaboration with other forces, but will continue to campaign against the regionalisation of policing and will ensure command and control remains within the county.
I have overseen major efficiency savings. For example, my office costs 30% less than the Police Authority it replaced – that’s about £350,000 a year to be ploughed back into frontline Neighbourhood Policing.
I am the Labour candidate but as PCC  I represent all local people. Where there are areas for improvement I will hold the Chief Constable to account in making these improvements. I will do this whilst recognising the high level of professionalism and integrity of the vast majority of officers  and staff. I will continue to support these officers and speak out against those who undermine Cleveland Police with unjustified and irresponsible attacks.

I have served with numerous specialist Police units including the Drugs Squad, Murder Investigation Team, Special Branch and the Organised Crime Unit, during my career with Cleveland Police.
My last Police position was that of elected Cleveland Police Federation Chairman where I was responsible for running the local Police staff association, managing the office and a team of dedicated Police officers.
Since leaving the Police I have worked as a security consultant and close protection operative, although in recent months I have worked on a part time basis with young men with autism, teaching life skills and offering positive support through my experiences. I am also a member of the Home Office appointed Police Appeals Tribunal Panel which reviews serious police misconduct matters.
I have a strong interest in my local community being the Chairman of my local Parish Council for the past few years where I’ve continued to be passionate about securing frontline policing.
With continuous and deep cuts to Police services, bad strategic decisions and an ever changing and challenging working environment, it’s no surprise that morale within the local Police force is at an all-time low. Cleveland needs a Police and Crime Commissioner that not only understands the problems, but has the experience and expertise needed to provide a real and tangible solution. I believe I can be that Commissioner.
With your support I can turn around the downward spiral within our Police force and give our determined frontline officers all of the tools they need to make our communities safer again.

Matthew would deliver a force where victims are put first, money is spent wisely and more officer time is spent actually policing.
Matthew is a local lad, having lived in the area all his life. He was born at North Tees Hospital, attended local schools and graduated from Teesside University. He is a councillor in Stockton with a strong reputation of standing up for local people and fighting wasteful spending. Matthew has a background in local business. Having completed a business degree, he worked in retail management for major companies. He also takes a keen interest in his family’s construction firm.
Matthew is passionate about law enforcement and crime prevention. He is a law graduate and has served on Stockton’s Crime & Disorder Committee and Cleveland’s Police & Crime Panel.
Matthew has a five-point plan to improve Cleveland Police:

Cutting Crime will be his number one objective


Reducing paperwork & bureaucracy and making use of technology to ensure our officers can spend more time actually policing. He’d also look to recruit more special constables.


Supporting tougher community sentences so justice can be seen to be done.


Pushing for more visible and effective neighbourhood policing. He’d reduce the amount of money spent on senior officers’ salaries and the back office to free up more resource to put more officers onto the streets.


Building trust in our police force and cleaning up its tarnished reputation.

My priorities are –

More visible policing in our towns and villages
Fighting Conservative government plans to cut police funding
Taking domestic violence more seriously
Tackling crimes against small businesses and farms
Campaigning against court closures

Cumbria police is under threat. Last year the Conservative government proposed cutting £21million from its budget. That’s the cost of over 400 front line police officers.
They might have delayed the cuts, but the government still intend to change the funding formula later this year.
I will fight tooth and nail for a fairer funding deal for Cumbria’s police.
As a proven manager, consultant and daughter of a former police officer, I’m also the right person to hold Cumbria police to account.
I want us to do more to stop re-offending.
We need restorative justice to support and help victims of crime, and we need to promote rehabilitation and youth services to help offenders turn their lives around and reduce re-offending rates.
We need to restore trust in Cumbria police, tackling anti-social behaviour and taking strong action on domestic violence and sexual exploitation
And if I’m elected as your PCC, I’ll publish my expenses on the web so you can see how your money is being spent.
When police budgets are being cut, your PCC needs to lead by example and spend wisely.  I also want to see a full and transparent recruitment process for all appointments to the PCC’s office, basing all appointments on merit.
With your support on 5th May I’ll make sure we have a police force that will keep Cumbria safe.

However, we cannot be complacent, Domestic Violence, Cybercrime, Child Sexual Exploitation are increasing. Terrorism is a constant threat. In Cumbria we must also prioritise rural crime to safeguard our families, homes, farms and tourist industries. 
I will make these and addressing all forms of anti-social behaviour my priorities, including securing the future of consistent safe provision for victims of crime and domestic abuse across Cumbria, I’ll introduce a youth commission to engage young people in preventing crime.
I have served our country on operations as diverse as peacekeeping in Bosnia, Foot and Mouth here in Cumbria and most recently in Sierra Leone fighting Ebola. I was Regimental Colonel of The Royal Logistic Corps, 16,000 personnel supporting Operations in Afghanistan, have had vast commercial experience and direct responsibility for multi million pound procurement, and operational budgets. 
The army culture is about leadership, teamwork and getting the job done, not committees talking about it, squabbling or making excuses, I will work with the police, communities and agencies as a team.
Balancing the books will always be challenging but I have worked at Ministry level and understand how government works, I will fight to safeguard our policing budget and front line police numbers, most importantly I will ensure Cumbria has a voice to government ministers.
Integrity, gaining your trust and doing the right thing are important to me. Unlike other candidates, I’m not a career politician, I left home in Wigton 34 years ago to become a soldier. I won’t make ‘politician’s promises,’ my mission is to work for you, to do all in my power to keep you and your family safe.

UKIP is a strong believer in Law and Order and that the Police have a very important role in a civilised society to protect ordinary people and allowing us to live our lives peacefully. At the same time there have been instances across the UK where the Police and connected authorities have needed more accountability and transparency to ensure that the Police etc. are working in our overall best interests.
Part of managing safety is crime prevention, which is both steering potential criminals away from crime, but also assisting existing criminals to change their lives away from criminal activity. The Commissioner has an important role to play in facilitating crime prevention initiatives.
The very large and unusual shape of Cumbria Police Area, and the locations of Police and Crime related bodies, brings many challenges and the Commissioner needs to be positioned so as to reach everywhere. My home is in Cockermouth, which fits in well with the road system giving convenient road access across the whole of the Cumbria Police Area.
A UKIP Commissioner will seek to represent everyone to ensure that we live peaceful lives, as safe from crime as is possible.

Prior to the reform of Policing I was Chair of the Cumbria Police Authority having held the position for 20 years. During that time we achieved the highest number of police officers, civilian staff, and recorded the most favourable crime figures ever by Cumbria Police. I was honoured to receive an OBE for my services to Policing and the People of Cumbria.
I am putting myself forward at this time of austerity and changes to Policing and other Blue Light Services to try and reverse the impact of the last four years on numbers of officers and neighbourhood Policing. I am concerned that cuts and future proposed cuts by the current Government will impact greatly, not only on Police moral but public confidence in the Service.
My priorities will be vandalism, disorder, anti-social behaviour but because of the large geography of Cumbria priorities can differ, what suits Barrow doesn’t suit Carlisle. Priorities can and will differ widely from month to month from farmland to town and village, and Police organisation needs to recognise this. Organised crime within the Country especially relating to child sexual exploitation and internet crime is increasing in the County as is the reporting of domestic violence. These are areas I will continue to focus on especially in regard to the training of ALL Police personnel.

My top priorities for policing are:

Campaign to abolish the Police and Crime Commissioners and return to Police Authorities.
Campaign to legalise and regulate the sale of cannabis.
Reduce costs to fund more community policing.
Hold regular public meetings around the county, so residents can voice their concerns.
Oppose any moves to privatise policing.

Police officers have a difficult job, but funding in Derbyshire is cut each year and numbers of officers reduced. I’ve lived in Derbyshire for twenty years and spent many years in industry managing large budgets. I know what it takes to cut costs. Cost savings that could pay for more officers in the community.
Visible policing is vital to reduce the fear of crime, which can impact as much as actual crime. I will oppose all proposals to privatise the activities of our police. Secure communities are our priority, not opportunities for private contractors to squeeze a profit from policing.
I don’t agree with the need for Police Commissioners and will campaign for their abolition, together with a return to Police Authorities. Police Commissioners have too much individual influence and power. A Police Authority, made up of elected councillors, better represents all of our views across the county.
The legal sale and use of cannabis will free up police time. Instead of criminalising users of cannabis, police will be able to target the real criminals that put hard drugs on our streets. It would take money away from the drug gangs and regulate what people buy. Regulate its production, control its sale, and free up police time.
With your support on May 5th I’ll ensure effective community policing.

He has deployed on operational tours in submarines and on land in both the 1991 and 2003 Iraq wars. Graduating with a Master’s degree in International Relations at Cambridge University in 2004, he served as a diplomat in the British Embassy Tokyo from 2007 – 2010, where he worked with UK and Japanese Ministers to secure high-level security co-operation between the two countries.
Determined to bring Labour values to the role of Police Commissioner as in his military career, he emphasises the need for fairness, honesty and teamwork in the strategic leadership of policing. His priorities are to continue the fight for proper funding, to restore effective local policing, and to ensure that the Police and his own staff are truly engaged with the people of Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.
After discussing with people throughout the region their concerns about policing he commented “There is a clear need to restore effective local-based policing, focused on crime risks that are changing rapidly and that vary from place to place. I am determined to modernise the police workforce and introduce new technology to ensure an ongoing visible presence, and provide the skills to address the complex challenges of today’s and tomorrow’s crime. Domestic abuse, sexual and other violent crimes, child sexual exploitation and rapidly increasing and worrying internet based crime are doing so much harm to our society. The most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society must get their fair share of policing”.
Gareth is married, with 3 children and has made his home in Plymouth and the surrounding areas since 1977.

Targeted Zero Tolerance in areas with increasing levels of violence.
Community Payback to reduce pressure on the criminal justice system.
Greater priority to wildlife and farm crime.
Drunk Tanks.
Youth Detox.
More random vehicle spot checks.
Enhanced community engagement.

We have a precious safe haven in Devon and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. However, levels of violent crime resulting in injury buck the trend and are increasing, as do levels of rape and family abuse, often alcohol related. On my watch, these levels will be reversed.
We will deliver the best for the South West. There will be no further police station closures and counter services will be restored by training more special constables.
Can this level of policing be sustained in an era of wanton cuts? Yes it can with sufficient vision, energy and vigilance.
As a practicing Christian, I believe in a world in which we each place an equal value on one another, gay or straight, black or white, those of all religions and those of none. Above all else I believe in respect for each other and respect for the precious environment we hold dear.

He is not a politician nor has he ever been one, he is one of the people and believes passionately in an independent but accountable Police Service, free from political interference. He is not new to fighting to save our Unique British Bobby having attended Parliament on numerous occasions to highlight this cause.
The imposition of the Police and Crime Commissioner provides the opportunity for politicians to direct Police Forces according to their own doctrine at the expense of Community priorities. The Office of The Police and Crime Commissioner will cost the Devon and Cornwall tax payer millions of pounds over the next four years.  This money would be far better spent on the Police Service instead of that extra level of bureaucracy it provides at the moment.
The job description of the Police and Crime Commissioner reflects that of the French Mayor.  Do we really want a Europol governed political police service?
That is why Jonathan wants to expose the gross misuse of public funds associated with this role and lobby for its dissolution.
He wants to reverse the policy of withdrawing police visibility from the community, review station closures and overhaul the 101 telephone system.  He wants to listen to your opinions, ensure ALL crimes are recorded and prioritise local issues instead of Government performance targets.  We can still stop the destruction of what was the best police force in the world, but we MUST act now.

His extensive range of both operational and strategic management took him to the heart of sensitive enquiries in the UK, Europe and USA.  With command of over 3,000 Police officers and staff, he has successfully managed multi-million pound budgets, delivering efficiency savings whilst improving performance.
Exceptionally calm under pressure, amongst many high-profile major incidents he commanded was the response to the Exeter Giraffe Restaurant terrorist bombing and its aftermath, receiving extremely favourable feedback from the Home Secretary.
Bob has served in large urban Policing environments, commanding response to gangland murders and shootings and, in rural communities, such diverse issues as the Foot-and-Mouth Disease outbreak in Devon and the aftermath of several terrorist activities across Devon and Cornwall.
Since leaving the Police as Acting Assistant Chief Constable 7 years ago, he has broadened his experience advising Government and blue-chip companies on crisis management and leadership. For nearly five years he was also a member of Devon’s Magistracy.  With a strong understanding of partner agencies and most importantly victims of crime, he has acted as independent chair of both Devon and Torbay’s Safeguarding Boards, tasks including child sexual exploitation and vulnerable adult safeguarding.
No stranger to tough decisions, Bob has dismissed senior executives who have failed to perform. He will actively listen to the community to ensure policing meets their crime prevention and policing needs.  Critically he has the skills and experience needed to challenge the Devon and Cornwall police to ensure they deliver for the people of Devon, Cornwall, Torbay, Plymouth and Isles of Scilly.
As an Independent, Bob would be free to act and free to speak on your behalf without political pressure.

Richard is an experienced campaigner and as Commissioner he will make the strongest case for Devon and Cornwall. His knowledge of Whitehall and how Westminster works is going to be vital to our securing the fair funding deal that our police force needs.
Richard has three main priorities:

  To secure a fair funding deal for the Devon and Cornwall Police Force.
  To maintain and improve the visibility of our police force and improve the 101 service.
  To protect the Force from a forced merger with Somerset and Avon which would only make decision making more remote.

His knowledge of the scrutiny process from the Defence Select committee gives him the skills to hold the Chief Constable to account.
He will be a truly independently minded Commissioner.
Richard will also press Government to abolish the post of Police and Crime Commissioner.
Richard believes that we need a strong democratic oversight of the Police, that listens to communities and gives them a greater say in how our streets are policed. We do not need that power given to a single person nor can we have the Police policing themselves. We need a strong body that can call on expert advice but is part of the community. This would be better done by something like the old Police Authority but with the same powers as have been given to the Police and Crime Commissioner. This will save money and allow more resources for more police officers.  Richard will work hard and in partnership with others to achieve this.

I was a Governor of a Further Education College for several years and served on its Project Board which oversaw the construction of two multi-million pound buildings. This involved careful planning and monitoring to ensure that these were delivered on time and on budget. As Chair of a charity I helped to develop a business plan to act on behalf of the public on issues of health and social care and set up a professional monitoring and audit process.
Cuts in Police funding mean that there may be even fewer staff and that response times could deteriorate. Labour will keep our police visible and offer you real power over what policing priorities should be. The role of the PCC puts too much power in the hands of one individual so I believe the job should be done completely differently. We must put communities at the heart of the fight against crime and give people a direct say in how to spend the resources which are continually being reduced by this Government.
The role of PCC must support those who are victims of crime as well as those at risk of offending. Supporting crime prevention measures is vital. I will oppose any suggestion of expanding the role to include the Fire & Rescue Service and am also opposed to having to having a paid deputy.
I will make the PCC more accountable and ensure that everyone gets their voice heard.

I have spent my working life dedicated to ensuring the security of our country. I believe that public safety and the rule of law are the bedrock foundations for positive, open and successful societies and communities. I see the appointment of PCC as an opportunity to put something back and help Dorset, where I live, face existing and developing criminal and other challenges to public safety.
I have worked closely with the Police, in particular for two years supporting the ACC South Region in Northern Ireland after the Good Friday Agreement. I admire what they do.
Having been burgled I understand the sense of intrusion, hurt and insecurity crime leaves behind. Crime blights lives. I also recognise that the Police cannot do everything on their own and the public has a part to play. A drumbeat theme of my tenure as PCC would be ‘Policing at the heart of our communities’ – not ‘Them’ and ‘Us’ but ‘WE’.
Dorset spends more than £120 million of taxpayers’ money each year on policing. I have held sizable public budgets (£100m – £1.2bn), delivered significant results and identified smart ways of shifting the costs of support and office functions towards the sharp end.
Since leaving the Army I have broadened my business experience by working in industry, leading a youth development charity and volunteering with a national mental health charity.
I have the proven and tested experience, leadership, vision, commitment and management skills to work with the Chief Constable and the people of Dorset to make and keep our county a safer place to live and to work and to visit.

A former serviceman, Dorset has been my home for over ten years and I was elected onto the Shaftesbury Town Council in 2015.
I served in the Royal Navy for 25 years, saw action in the Falklands conflict of 1982 on board HMS Sheffield and supported the United Nations peace-keeping efforts in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. My final posting was as the UK nuclear deterrent operational planning officer.
On leaving the RN I worked as a manager in the NHS before qualifying as a financial adviser.
The freedom to be independent
Unlike other parties UKIP does not insist that its politicians follow a party whip. That leaves me free to use my own initiative to act in the best interests of keeping the people of Dorset safe.
With the power of a political party
But I will have the strength of UKIP behind me to apply pressure when necessary to help me in my task. Such as arguing for increased government funding to finance more bobbies on the beat, the jewel in the Crown of British policing.
A completely fresh perspective
The job of Police and Crime Commissioner is to hold the Chief Constable to account, not to try and run the police. I am not a former police officer, so I have no pre-conceived notions about what can and cannot be changed. It is time to bring new thinking to the table.
I am a graduate of BRNC Dartmouth and the Open University, have a post-graduate diploma in management studies and am a member of the Chartered Management Institute.

As a former police officer and your Dorset PCC since 2012, I understand how policing and the role of the PCC fit together. Dorset is a special place; I understand the County and its people.
I have overseen the Force through unprecedented cuts and changes in demand.
I have:

Introduced the Victims’ Bureau to help victims in their journey. I have commissioned support services for victims.
Improved mental health provision for people in crisis, improving their care and reducing demand on police. I lead nationally for PCCs in this arena.
Introduced the Strategic Alliance between Dorset, Devon and Cornwall police, improving efficiency and delivering huge savings.
Worked nationally with Government on areas such as use of force, taser, fraud and mental health, benefiting Dorset people. I have led the call for a funding review which gives Dorset a fairer deal.
Listened to the public and interacted with 250,000 people; approximately 35,000 being face to face. I have won national awards for transparency and engagement with communities; each community in Dorset is different.

I will:
Invest resources to protect Dorset people from emerging threats of:

Targeting and abuse of those at risk
Cyber crime

Invest in the Marine Unit.
Continue to talk to local people; to be the interface with their police.
Continue to represent and support victims.
Improve accessibility and visibility of your police.
Improve technology and efficiency.
Establish a rural crime team.
Appoint a business crime champion.
Dedicate resources to keep you safer on Dorset’s roads.
Support Neighbourhood Policing.

It is an amazing part of the best country in the world. The North East has an exciting future and growing prosperity.
But we can tackle crime better.
In addition to my day job in health care, I run a non-profit organisation aimed at reducing offending and reoffending. The Centre for Crime Prevention backs ‘broken windows’, zero tolerance policing and tougher sentencing for serious, repeat offenders who plague communities.
I want to bring these insights into local policing. My six point plan for Darlington and Durham is:

Greater visibility for police

Getting more police out of their offices and cars so they are patrolling a beat on foot. This lets police really get to know the local community, who the troublemakers are, and pick up local knowledge.

Slash needless bureaucracy and paperwork

Work with police and use new technology to cut red tape.

Implement ‘broken windows’, zero tolerance policing

Tackling anti-social behaviour and so-called ‘low level’ crimes is key to making local communities safer.

Campaign for much tougher sentences for serious, repeat offenders

Appeal to the Attorney General against lenient sentences and encourage prosecutors to pursue the toughest charges. Invest in victim support, assisting victims in making the most persuasive statements before the courts.

Avoid treating the motorist as a cash cow

Speed cameras should be used only to tackle serious speeding – not to get more revenue from the motorist.

Go on patrol with local police at least one day per week

… and publish all expenses online.
 
I will be the public’s representative to the police, not the other way round. I will be relentless in tackling anything that gets in the way of cutting crime.

I said then that I wanted to build a strong Police Force which delivered an excellent service, as many of you will know Durham Constabulary has been judged as the best Force in England and Wales.
Much of this success has been achieved through close working with our communities and I remain committed to that. 
This success has been achieved in spite of the savage Government cuts to our budget. We have lost over £20m, over 300 police officers and hundreds of police staff. 
The next four years will be challenging, but with your support we can ensure that we continue to provide a policing service of the highest quality.
During this four years I commit as follows;
To oppose the privatisation of policing. The Police service you receive must remain publicly accountable.
I will oppose further cuts to policing, and argue for a funding formula that delivers a fair budget.
I will ensure that we have the right mix of skills and staff, so that we have a police service fit for the 21st century. Plans are already well developed.
I will continue to place victims at the heart of our service, ensuring the highest quality of service to victims of crime and anti social behaviour. 
I will seek to protect the vulnerable, ensuring that I continue our work tackling domestic abuse, violence against women and girls and the protection of victims of hate crime.
I ask for your support to allow me to seek to deliver and excellent police service over the next four years.

Here are my top priorities for making our streets safer:

Safeguard frontline police
Cut re-offending
More focus on prevention

Police officers have a tough job and they need more support. Further policing cuts will stretch their ability to keep us safe. That’s why I’ll campaign to remove the unnecessary and overly expensive PCC role. To put money into policing rather politics.
The police we do have are too often tied up in red tape. We need to free up the police to spend less time behind computers and more time on the streets.
I’ll also make sure we do more to stop re-offending.
Focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice – so people pay back to victims and the local community – would cut crime, save police time and taxpayers’ money.
Finally, more needs to be done to stop people becoming criminals in the first place. We need to identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults before they fall into a life of crime.
I have worked as a local teacher and trustee of a charity that looks after 5,000 young people across the North East. I know what it takes to keep people on the straight and narrow.
I’ll use that experience to ensure we’re doing all we can to tackle the causes of crime in our communities.
For the last decade I’ve led successful local campaigns to help people across Durham and Darlington get things done and hold politicians to account.
With your support on May 5th I’ll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

The consequences of each casualty extends far beyond each individual involved to families, neighbours and whole communities. The Police need to work with councils, the Welsh Government and others to tackle this appalling loss of life on our roads.
Police accountability happens best at the most local level. My focus will be to act as the catalyst to build and strengthen links between the police and the communities they serve, and to involve local community leaders in my decisions. The Police Commissioner needs to build links with special interest groups, such as the farming community, vulnerable people, victims of domestic abuse, ethnic minorities and others to understand their needs, to know how best to prevent crime and to ensure that all people are treated fairly.
The Police Commissioner needs to rebuild the morale of our Police force after a series of poor HMIC inspections. The Commissioner needs to take some responsibility when things go wrong, and end the denial of poor performance reports.
I will cut the costs of the Police Commissioners Office to invest in front line policing and I will oppose moves to extend the powers of Police Commissioners into other services. Police Commissioners were created without public consent, and I will press for their replacement by elected councillors.
Living in Welshpool I understand the concern that the far flung parts of Dyfed Powys area feel neglected. As a former member of a police authority and a former councillor with many years’ experience I believe I am well qualified to take on this role.

Over many years, I have participated in the Social and Welfare activities throughout the whole area of Dyfed.  
Having had the distinction of being elected an INDEPENDENT member of the Dyfed County Council for the whole period of it’s existence (1973 – 1996), the knowledge gained as a Senior Scientific Officer in both private and public industries has given me valuable and widespread experience in dealing with the needs, aspirations and well being of people and communities.
We are fortunate to live in a democratic Country which allows free speech and for individuals to have different political preferences. Consequently, an elected Police Commissioner should not be influenced by Party Politics in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. Each and every one must be treated on an equal basis in the eyes of the Law. The vast of the majority of you and every serving police officer are in total agreement with these sentiments.
The last few years have seen the influence of Party Politics manifesting itself in the disruptive running of our Police Force. The controversy surrounding the Police helicopter, the handling of closure of Police Stations, removal of several CCTV cameras, increase in crime, public safety and several other serious matters. I can give my ASSURANCE that these concern will be addressed as quickly as possible after the May 5th Election.
One has always acted with TOTAL HONESTY and COMPLETE INTEGRITY at all times and I shall continue to do so if entrusted with your CONFIDENCE on May 5th as your INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONER.
‘KEEP PARTY POLITICS OUT OF POLICING’

I will provide a leadership you can trust and work with the Chief Constable to deliver a motivated workforce within an efficient and effective model for local Policing and Criminal Justice.
TRUST & EFFICIENCY
I am approachable and will listen to all members of the community in order to shape a successful Police Force. Reducing bureaucracy and ensuring open access to the Police and Criminal Justice will be a priority.
• I will hold public meetings across the Force – open to everyone;
• I will not appoint an unelected Deputy Commissioner and I will reduce external consultant costs;
• I will increase the use of volunteers and keep local stations and offices open;
• I will not privatise core police support functions that will fragment the delivery of services.
SECURITY & SAFETY
The safety of everyone in Dyfed and Powys is important to me across all our communities, both rural and urban. Preventing crime and anti-social behaviour will be prioritised to reduce demand for services alongside the resourcing of serious, organised and on-line crime. I will ensure victims have a voice and are fully supported with the services they need.
• I will ensure that front line policing is supported and resourced in line with the needs of the public;
• I will invest in a modern CCTV infrastructure to improve the safety of our towns and communities;
• I will support and fund services for our youth and vulnerable groups;
• I will work with local authority departments, charities and communities;
• I will resource specialist units to deal with serious, organised and on-line crime;
• I will prioritise the safety of our roads, targeting reckless drivers and protecting road users.

I have lived in the Dyfed Powys area all my life. As your Commissioner I would prioritise front line policing and always put victims first. I want to concentrate on the issues that matter to the people of Dyfed Powys – tackling crime and anti-social behaviour head on, strengthening community policing and combatting drugs and domestic abuse. As your Police Commissioner, I will work with our dedicated police officers and staff, our rural and urban communities and other public bodies to deliver a police service which is strong, responsive and fair.
If you elect me on May 5th, my priorities will be:
1. Extra police officers on the beat in towns and villages across Dyfed Powys – by shifting all possible resources to front line policing.
2. Restoring live CCTV camera coverage at key times in antisocial behaviour and crime hotspots.
3. A focus on combating domestic abuse and improving specialist support services in Dyfed Powys.
4. Bringing police officers closer to the communities they serve by opening more community police rooms in schools and other local facilities.
5. New initiatives to combat the scourge of drug dealers and drug abuse in Dyfed Powys.
6. Establish a new Countryside Crime Unit to meet the distinct needs of our rural communities.

I am a great supporter of the Dyfed-Powys Police and the people it serves. I believe I understand policing and know how it can be best organised to work in the interests of the public. My core beliefs are:-
a. That policing is at its best when it is local.
b. That cuts to front line policing and police stations should be avoided whenever possible.
c. That where cuts have to be made they should be made to back office functions.
d. That police officers and civilian staff need to be supported in carrying out their often difficult and dangerous duties, not criticised, as so often happens now.

I grew up on a farm in Powys, before becoming an Army officer. Now I live in Carmarthenshire. I am determined to keep all our communities safe in these tough times.
Since my election as Police and Crime Commissioner in 2012, crime and anti-social behaviour are down 12%, more than anywhere else in Wales. I have delivered more police officers in our towns and villages. They are spending over 100,000 extra hours on the beat keeping you safe. I have scrapped bureaucratic targets, so officers can do what they do best – preventing crime and catching criminals.
I have saved your money to invest in frontline policing. Your police cost local households 5% less than when I was elected. I have delivered safer communities and lower household bills.
I want Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Powys to be even safer. I want to protect our poorest and most vulnerable; when they are safe, we are all safe.
Safer Homes. I will: increase support for victims of sexual and domestic abuse, to help them rebuild their lives; tackle drugs and alcohol; and ensure offenders pay their dues and put their lives in order.
Safer Work. I will: introduce a business forum, to protect businesses from the costs of crime; improve capacity to tackle cyber crime; support fraud victims; and prioritise road safety.
Safer Communities.  I will: prioritise frontline officers, to prevent crime; introduce Special Constables for every community that wants one; and give more control to local people to tackle speeding.
I have the experience. I have the plan. Now I am asking for your support on May 5th to keep us safe for the next four years.

My priorities for policing in Essex are aimed at mending the damaged elements of our society by:
I understand that Essex Police and Crime Commissioner is a challenging role, and public safety is important to all Essex’s residents. The government has undertaken to protect police budgets for the rest of this parliament, but the Police Service will still need to modernise: to be local and accessible, and use new technologies and media to be more open and efficient. Where this has been done elsewhere we know they spend a fifth more of their time out on patrol. And to make sure policing is local, I aim to put a Special Constable in every community.
My experience as Cabinet Member at Essex County Council and Deputy Leader at Brentwood Council will enable me to help the Police prioritise and manage their resources, and lead to more effective and efficient policing in Essex. Professionally, I have over thirty years’ experience as a leading financial analyst at major British, European and American banks. In doing so I have successfully led and shaped large organisations who serve millions of people. Essex Police is different, but I can offer them the same qualities of innovative thinking, leadership, and the ability to inspire. These will let me help the Police deliver and enable me to hold them to account when they need to improve.

It is short of money to deal with these issues following decades of underfunding – by Conservatives nationally and those in Essex who set Police budgets.
Essex’s next Police and Crime Commissioner must fix these issues. If elected I will:
Listen to the concerns of local communities and the victims of crime when setting priorities for Essex.
Tackle issues that have not been resourced properly, such as the 85 incidents of domestic abuse in Essex every single day.
Work with councils and other Essex agencies so our limited resources go further, tackling the root causes of crime; and work with partners across UK and EU to share crime information.
I have lived around Essex all my life. I understand the needs of victims and residents, and the challenges facing Essex Police.
Far too many politicians talk “tough on crime”, but do things that don’t work – and sometimes makes things worse. A good example is illegal drugs.
The emphasis should be on arresting gangs and dealers that make people’s lives miserable. Some users should be treated as a medical, not criminal, issue. This could free up police time to deal with more serious crime.
With joined up thinking between police, councils, schools and other agencies we can stop anti-social behaviour before it becomes criminal, and tackle underlying causes.
We must tackle re-offending, using methods that have worked elsewhere. Where victims are willing to meet criminals, this has cut re-offending significantly. By rehabilitating offenders through reconciliation and restorative justice, re-offending can be reduced, saving the police and the courts time and money.

Zero Tolerance Policing ex Chief

Relentlessly pursue more funding for Essex Police   
Take a Zero Tolerance approach to policing in Essex
Deliver more visible street policing
Put victims at the centre of the criminal justice system
Give you more opportunities to have your say about policing
Protect your local policing by standing up for Officers and Essex Police.

 My campaign is supported by Mick Thwaites, former Divisional Commander, Head of Mobile Support-Police Operations and Temporary Assistant Chief Constable for Essex Police. Other ex Essex Officers are indicating they will support and work with me so that informed decisions are made.
Having been born, lived and worked most of my life in Essex, an Independent Councillor for 13 years, coupled with my career in local industry, I know the County of Essex well. I understand the make-up of the county in its individual and unique communities, so I will not have a parochial mind set. I am a strategic thinker and I have the determination to fight for what is right for all our towns and villages across Essex.
I believe that the hallmark of any civilised society is community safety, with the cuts imposed by the government and approved by the current PCC Essex citizens are less safe. Recently published figures show crime is up, conviction rates are down. In fact I believe the current bad set of numbers are not accurate, the figures are significantly higher.
Community safety is in my DNA and is under threat; I pledge to defend all of our communities.

In the last year violent crime in Essex increased by 14%, yet since 2010 the amount of Police Officers in the county has decreased by over 500, whilst PCSO numbers have been decimated.
As Labour’s Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), I will focus on tackling the increase of violent crime across Essex and in particular the rise in domestic violence. I’ll do this by working to ensure that we have an effective and efficient police service that is in the heart of communities, to support victims as well as working to prevent crime.
With my background in Education, I understand how crime can affect communities and how vital a preventative approach to policing is. However, that isn’t just about education; it’s also about visible, frontline policing in local communities, and building effective partnerships across the public and voluntary sector. Of course, the Tory cuts in police budgets will make our task harder, but there is much that can be done to protect those most at risk of crime.
I also want to help support police officers and police staff, who work hard under increasingly difficult circumstances. That’s why I will work ceaselessly to protect frontline policing and ensure that our officers and staff are able to do their jobs to keep the people of our community safe.
The last Labour Government coined a phrase which is as true today as it was then ‘Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime’ and that will be my approach, if elected, as your PCC in May

Barry is a Gloucestershire County Councillor and Deputy Leader of the Labour Group. He has been involved in a wide range of community activities, including starting the Kingsway Residents Association, local rugby coaching and community radio, as well as being a parish councillor. He has campaigned on a number of issues including leading the campaign against the closing of county magistrates’ courts.
Barry’s focus is on:

Policing in Partnership – Working with local community organisations
Tackling Domestic Violence – Focusing on both physical and psychological abuse
Rural Policing – Ensuring that Rural Communities are properly supported
Policing Cyberspace – Ensuring we can use the Internet confidently and safely
Community Policing – Bringing residents and police closer together

Barry is the Deputy Chair of the Gloucestershire Police and Crime Panel and has been a Magistrate in Gloucestershire. This experience has given Barry an understanding of local issues and a wide view of the justice system. Barry says: “I want to see the whole justice system work effectively for victims, witnesses, the police, defendants and the many volunteers involved in the delivery of justice.”
In his day job, Barry runs a small human science research and technology company in Gloucester. This provides him with the practical experience of budgeting, planning and motivating people.

I am standing as an Independent because I believe party politics has no place in policing. I am also standing to continue the work I began in November 2012. 
Much progress has been made since then and with your support I hope to build on it. My aims, therefore, may be familiar.
If I am re-elected, I will prioritise making our police more visible and come when we need them. I want older people to feel safe and I want a system that works for young people not against them. Everyone, whatever their age or background, should feel safe day or night and be able to use our streets and public places without feeling threatened.
I will introduce new measures aimed at making our roads safer and continue working with our young people to make them more responsible, better drivers. The investment in tackling cybercrime, which has put the Constabulary at the forefront of counteracting criminality on the internet, will also continue.
On my watch, Gloucestershire has become a UK leader in “Restorative Justice”, the service where criminals and their victims are brought together. This has proven benefits for victims and reduces re-offending and I will continue to support it.
I am the only candidate with experience of being Police and Crime Commissioner and as an experienced former officer, I am also the only candidate in Gloucestershire with direct policing experience.
My record shows I kept all the promises I made to you before the last election and the Constabulary has benefited as a result. Check www.policecommissioner.net or www.gloucestershire-pcc.gov.uk
I’m Trustworthy, I’m Independent, I’m Experienced, I’m Local.

I currently work in partnership with five local businesses, directly employing over 50 people, and have a proven record in delivering an efficient and effective emergency service. I understand the importance of organisation, efficiency and leadership, which are vital to delivering an effective police force as your Police and Crime Commissioner.
A PCC must listen and respond to the needs of the local community. In 1999 I was elected as a Councillor for the Forest of Dean and three years later became a member of Gloucestershire County Council.
As a Councillor I have undertaken various responsibilities that make me well suited to a role that requires working with the police as well as overseeing the budget to ensure taxpayer’s money is spent wisely. For the past eight years I have been the Cabinet Member responsible for running Gloucestershire’s Fire and Rescue Service. With a staff of 400 firefighters and 22 fire stations, by working together we have reduced our budget by more than 20%, without undermining frontline services.
I have also led Gloucestershire’s Trading Standards and the Coroners service, carrying out key law enforcement responsibilities, and joined the Chief Constable on the Road Safety Partnership.
We need someone with experience to deliver smart, strategic savings in the police as the County Council has done in other areas.
My police plan will focus on 5 key areas:
Keeping the county safe from terrorism.
Preventing crime and anti-social behaviour.
Greater protection for victims of domestic violence.
Better policing for all of Gloucestershire.
Collaboration to save money and improve efficiency.

My time at the National Assembly includes over three years as a member of the Welsh Government. First as the Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology and then as the Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty.
Policing must be viewed as a public service based on our key principles of fairness and social justice. My priorities for policing in Gwent are:

A visible presence on our streets and communities. I know that the type of crime that blights our communities more than any other is anti-social behaviour in all its forms.
Ensuring that crimes such as domestic abuse, hate crime, child exploitation, and modern slavery are given the attention that they deserve.
Developing and maintaining good community cohesion. This is especially important for vulnerable sections of our communities.
Working with the Voluntary Sector so that their expertise in a range of areas (e.g. mental health and homelessness) can help inform on-going policies and practices.
Working with the Chief Constable so that our principles of social justice become the cornerstone of police practice.
Working with the Welsh Government and the devolved public services and on practical issues of support such as the provision of the additional Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) for Gwent.
Playing its part in counter terrorism activities.

All of this must be worked for in the face of cuts to the police budget, by the Tory UK Government, over the last five years.
This will demand strong partnerships with Education, Social Services, the NHS, and other key providers of public services.
I believe that I have the experience and commitment to make policing reflect our values of social justice.

As Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent, my single priority will be:
 
Improving Gwent Police’s ability to RESPOND to crime and to PREVENT crime.
 
I will achieve this by:
 
Improved use of police time towards ‘front-line duties’:
I will review the Chief Constable’s Force Delivery Plan and publish a new Gwent Police & Crime Plan.
 
Implementing a new Gwent Victim’s Charter:
I will place victims of crime at the heart of its development.
 
Increasing public confidence in Gwent Police:

Explore innovative ways to share community buildings 
Develop a new Volunteer Custody Visit scheme 
Annual Merit Awards for serving officers/staffTackling offending/re-offending:
I will establish Employability Support Programmes that:
 


Support young people at risk of engaging/re-engaging in criminal activity through sport, creative Industries and 121 employment mentoring
Engage ages 25+ who following prison re-settle within Gwent via meaningful 121 employment mentoring programmes
 

Closure of Courts 
As Commissioner I will hold those responsible to account for this deplorable policy, which places an unforgivable burden on our communities.
 
Community Engagement
I will create a Gwent Community Engagement Unit engaging you in strengthening ‘our’ Police & Crime Plan.
 
If you would like to see a vibrant, challenging Commissioner with an innovative approach to tackling crime, then I respectfully request your support on May 5th.
 
Thank you

He’s patrolled the streets for many years across Hampshire and knows the problems that frontline Police Officers face every day.
“I believe that the best way to know about policing needs in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight is to have served in the Police locally,” says former PC Richard Adair.
As Hampshire and Isle of Wight Police Commissioner Richard Adair will have three clear priorities,
1. Protecting frontline policing from cuts. If the Government force cuts on the Police, senior   management not frontline Police Constables should be reduced.
2. The public should be able to meet Police Officers when they need them, so Police Stations need to be maintained.
3. Mental Health services need real resource from Government so that Police Officers do not become mental health social workers doing a job they are not trained for.
Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are a large police area but the common sense answers to local policing problems are more likely to come from someone who has been a policeman in the Hampshire Constabulary for over 30 years.
For a Policeman to be in charge of Hampshire Police Force please support the real expert; former Hampshire Police Officer for 30 years Richard Adair, Liberal Democrat.

• Preventing crime in the first place.
• Improving frontline Policing.
• Reducing re-offending.
• Educating & supporting young people.
• Supporting Victims and witnesses.
• Preventing crime against business.
• Protecting against cyber crime.
I’m again standing as an Independent, non-Party Political candidate, because I believe YOUR Police Commissioner must be free from the influences of Political masters in Westminster.
Over the past 3 ½ years, in the face of huge cuts, I’ve successfully delivered an efficient and effective police service.
By taking a businesslike approach to all we do, operational policing is starting to see benefits. My Estates Strategy has modernised the Constabulary, is saving money while delivering a more efficient and modern working environment for frontline officers. Investment in technology – Body Worn Video, mobile communications and working with partners has brought the Constabulary to the forefront of modern policing.
Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary classed our financial planning for the future as “outstanding”, recognised my commitment to neighbourhood policing, ensuring police officers and PCSO’s remain on our streets, engaging with communities – delivering traditional policing in the modern environment. HMIC also noted we are good at preventing crime, anti-social behaviour and working effectively to reduce reoffending.
For me, the role of Police and Crime Commissioner is not just about governance of the Constabulary. It is, and importantly, about co-ordinating community responsibility to bring about “social change”, working with others to prevent crime, reduce re-offending, support victims and protect the vulnerable.
If re-elected, I will build on my successes since 2012 and tackle the new challenges faced by policing in modern times, with a focus on young people, the vulnerable, businesses and early prevention.

I was an international business lawyer, and specialised in IT Law, founding my firm’s practice in that area in 1983. I have lived in Southampton, Winchester, Fleet and the Borough of Fareham. I now live in East Hampshire, where I have been a local Councillor since 2003, and was an Independent Candidate in the Hampshire PCC election in 2012.
The OPCC is an unnecessary and politicised tier of government and a waste of public money. Its huge cost would be better spent on local police stations to ensure local community policing and intelligence to combat terrorism.
The police should be empowered to do their job, with minimum interference. The OPCC should scrutinise the police, not tell them what to do. It should ensure that serious complaints about the police are properly and independently investigated.
The Commissioner should be independent of all major political parties, and dedicated to ensuring that the law is applied equally to all. No one person should have these powers. As Commissioner I would act as Chairman of a panel of unpaid volunteers, as with the old police authority, and without a PR department.
Priorities, especially terrorism, robbery, drug-related crime, and sexual exploitation are obvious to the police. So is the rise in cyber-crime, where I am well-connected and qualified to help. More work is needed to recover the proceeds of crime, and to ensure that all crimes are recorded and investigated.
My Promises
• To consult regularly throughout Hampshire to help police officers deliver what the public wants and needs.
• Not to take a salary and use the funds saved to assist voluntary organisations for the prevention of crime and protection of victims.

I will champion your priorities.
They should also expect someone with the skills and experience to create a Police & Crime Plan that enhances effective delivery at the front line of policing and maximises the impact for a safer Hampshire from a £300M budget. I know it is not just how much, but also how effectively resources are used. I will fight for the necessary resources and their most effective use in keeping us safe.
My focus will always be to keep you and your family safe. And I will seek to empower the Chief Constable and our police to do what they do best – prevent crime and catch criminals.
My priorities will include:
• Protecting and improving neighbourhood and front line policing
• Tackling domestic abuse, protecting the vulnerable
• Putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system
• Addressing rural crime
• Seeking innovation that increases effectiveness & reduces bureaucracy
• Creating strong partnerships.
I have the skills for the job. A Commodore with 30 years’ experience in the Royal Navy – including running £100m+ projects; managing complex change programmes in tight financial times; and motivating teams of experienced personnel dedicated to the nation’s protection.
And from my time as a Borough Councillor, I know how to champion individuals and local communities; set strategic priorities; protect and sustain our values and society; and, most importantly, listen to residents.
I have the experience and the plan. Now I am asking for your support on 5th May to make Hampshire & IoW safer.

Crime fell by 43% under the last Labour Government but that record is now under threat. I am talking to our communities about the problems they face and will ensure resources are prioritised to deal with them.
The Government is planning to take the fire and rescue service away from local government and merge it with the police service. This is an attempt to reduce spending on services. The people who work in the two services do not want this. We already have cooperation and sharing of premises between the two services in Hampshire and I oppose this bureaucratic plan.
I have worked as a solicitor most of my life in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. I have given free legal advice and worked for Portsmouth City Council. I ran my own firm of solicitors in Ryde which included criminal and family work, and have extensive experience of the courts system.
The Government’s claim that crime is falling is not true of many types of crime. Some of my priorities would be:
• Put resources into front line policing for community safety and reducing anti-social behaviour.
• Ensure officers have the expertise to deal with escalating cybercrime.
• Recognise the high cost of rural crime in Hampshire.
• Helping people with mental health problems takes up much police time. I will campaign for improved mental health services.
• I oppose increased court charges and the reduction in legal aid and will investigate their impact.

His last job was managing the leadership Department for Hampshire Police, training police leaders.
He has extensive experience as a senior leader and executive with the NHS, Sodexho Alliance and he has managed two high profile Law firms. Roy came second in the GE2016 in the New Forest.
Roy’s message is simply this: “In a few years Hampshire has lost, 1000 cops and 1700 staff, you cannot run a 21st Century police service in this way. This blinkered approach has seen huge increases in crime and increased danger to the public. It’s time to take back our communities and provide the people of Hampshire/IOW with a Police Service they want, not what Government think they need”. Roy will lead a new empowering partnership between the people and the police, to deliver a new standard in effective policing. Roy will not allow police to be replaced by civilians with few powers. He wants more police officers to work the streets, get close to communities again and start making people feel safe. Intelligence is key in the fight against crime and violence, the only way to gather that is to get cops closer to the public. The French and Belgian police are now changing back to this model. Roy promises 100’s more cops, increased road safety, more firearms officers, less wastage and more transparency, and a more effective and efficient PCC office, which is value for money. A vote for Roy is a vote for strong empowering leadership and much needed change.

As an ex chief police officer I understand policing from communities and neighbourhoods to serious and organised crime and counter terrorism. As a lifelong member of the community I understand what the people of Hampshire and Isle of Wight expect from their police and partners in preventing and reducing crime and anti social behaviour.
I will;
• Take a zero tolerance approach to policing in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.
• Deliver more visible and effective Policing across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in both urban and rural areas.
• Put victims at the centre of the criminal justice system.
• Give you, the public who pay for policing more opportunity to have your say.
• Protect your local policing by standing up for the officers and staff of the Hampshire Constabulary.
• Ensure that you receive the highest possible standard of service from the Hampshire Constabulary
• Work with local partners in the Criminal Justice System and beyond to ensure that everyone plays their full part in protecting the people of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.
People across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight want the police to protect them and their families by delivering an effective and robust deterrent to criminals and those who blight our lives, at the same time supporting the vulnerable. I will ensure that the police and their partners stand up for decent people.

As an independent member of the Herts Police Joint Audit Committee, I have gained a very useful insight into what is wrong with policing in the county.
The number of operational police stations has nosedived from 15 down to just 4. Many Hertfordshire residents now find themselves miles from their nearest police hub. The emergency calls target is to dispatch officers within a three minute period – currently over 40% fail to meet this target. Hertfordshire has seen crime such as burglary rise as a result of short sighted decisions which are to your detriment.
Our greatest resource in tackling crimes is the professionalism of Police Officers and the dedication of support staff. We need to ensure that this is not jeopardised for short term political expedience.

I will hold the police to account on behalf of the public. I will also hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the force.
I will provide the link between the police and communities working to turn your aspirations, in terms of policing and crime reduction, into action.
I will seek to improve policing, deliver community safety and reduce crime, while ensuring value for money.
I will set the strategic direction and aims for Herts Police through the Police and Crime Plan.

My key pledges

Prioritising the victim and ensuring the offender faces justice.
Zero tolerance on crime including anti-social behaviour.
A clampdown on bail, for those deemed likely to abscond.
More visibility of police on our streets.
Crackdown on speeding in villages and residential areas.
Overhaul of the police complaints system.

If I am re-elected I intend to make sure it stays that way.
My focus has been on delivering a top quality service and doing so more efficiently. By collaborating with neighbouring forces and investing in new technology, I have met the savings targets set by the Government, cut the amount that local people pay for policing and maintained a top performing police force. By improving efficiency I have avoided the cuts seen in other areas and protected local policing, keeping officers on the frontline. I believe that protecting neighbourhood policing is vital not just because it is effective in cutting crime but also because it’s the style of policing which people in Hertfordshire have told me they prefer.
I have put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. The Beacon Victim Care Centre is funded by money raised from offenders through the courts and has provided support to thousands of victims of crime. Sadly it remains the case that many victims are let down by their experience of other parts of the criminal justice system including the courts and this is something I am determined to tackle.
I am excited at the opportunities PCCs are being given to make sure all of our emergency services work more closely together to provide a better service to the public. I have played a leading role in the national debate on improving Bluelight collaboration and it is something I intend to take forward if re-elected as PCC in Hertfordshire.

I believe that people are more important than money. Justice and social equality require good public services funded by the principle of, ‘To each according to needs, from each according to means’. The police service is one such public service, and we must fund the police so that they can tackle crime effectively.
Labour stands for strong public services. I’m especially committed to maintaining and developing a good police service.
I deplore the Tory reduction in the number of police stations across Hertfordshire, and will strive for more help for the police in tackling telephone and internet crime.
In this PCC election, you have two votes, enabling you to exercise preference between candidates who may not be your first choice. In Hertfordshire, the practical choice is between Labour and Conservative candidates. So, had enough of the penny-pinching austerity of the Tory Hertfordshire Police budget, then please give me one, or both, of your two preferences, to help make Hertfordshire a safe, secure and pleasant place to live?
Elected as your PCC, I promise to work full-time as Commissioner, and will take the new ‘living wage’ as pay.

He has built a reputation as a formidable campaigner.
Chris has extensive experience of working on policing issues in his local community and was formerly chair of the Hertfordshire Police Authority Audit Committee.
Chris has worked in accountancy, training and public affairs. He was a member of the Audit Commission’s Board from 2005 to 2011 and is currently Deputy Leader of the Local Government Association’s Liberal Democrat Group.
Chris says: ‘It is important that policing remains local – that while we work with other forces, it remains a Hertfordshire force focussed on Hertfordshire issues.’
Chris’s other key priorities:

Make sure there are adequate resources for tackling crimes against women and girls: domestic crimes are systematically underreported and it is time to take them much more seriously.
Bear down on costs and ensure greater efficiency: freeing up the police to spend less time behind computers and more time on the streets.
Ensure that Hertfordshire’s night time economy prospers as a safe environment for visitors: too often our high streets are intimidating for local people and those on a quiet night out.
Work more closely with local authorities to ensure that roads are safer.
Make sure that there is adequate funding for the police, rather than meaningless tax cuts that the service can ill afford.
Open up decision-making so that the public can more fully participate in and challenge the Commissioner’s priorities.

With your support on May 5th I’ll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

I’ve injected Conservative common sense and values into policing to drive long overdue reforms and improvements to keep you and your communities safe.
I have not only protected the number of frontline and neighbourhood Police Officers for the next five years, but spent money wisely giving officers the secure mobile technology and training they need to tackle crime and spend up to 20% more hours on the beat, not stuck behind desks at the station.
I’m proud of my record so far, delivering on the things that matter most to you and your family. I’ve been listening to your views to help produce a clear 5-point plan to keep you and your family safe;

It’s outrageous that the post of Police Commissioner is paid more than the Leaders of Hull and East Riding Councils put together. I’ll set up a dedicated fund of £25,000 a year to support victims of crime instead.
That’s not the only way I’ll lead by example in tough times. I will not appoint any political ‘deputy commissioners’ paid for by taxpayers. That money should be spent on policing.
Covering such a large area, it’s easy for a Police and Crime Commissioner to become remote and out of touch.
I want to be a new kind of Commissioner – listening and available to local residents. I will hold an open surgery in every city, town and parish each year.
My top priority will be front-line policing in local communities. Humberside Police moved away from that model last year, and it hasn’t worked. The recent inspection report showed community police officers were worried they couldn’t do their jobs properly. That has to change.
I have lived and worked in the Humberside Police area for over 25 years. I am an experienced manager, with a long career in local business and manufacturing. I’ve supported local manufacturing companies and helped their apprentices and engineers improve their skills.
So I know what it’s like to lead a big organisation, and to get the best from the people who work for it. I have the skills and experience necessary to lead a large organisation and do it well.
Above all, my fight isn’t against any of the other candidates – it’s to make our area safer, for all of us who live here.

Keith had a 30 year police career, working on both banks of the Humber, starting on the beat and concluding as a senior officer with national recognition for his strategic leadership, management and business planning skills. His strong and principled leadership, putting communities first, led to huge reductions in crime, innovations in delivering efficiencies and excellent partnership working contributing to the best public confidence ratings in the region. This success led to Keith being headhunted as part of a small national team tasked with improving underperforming police forces.
Since leaving the Police, Keith has built a new career as a leadership, management and criminal justice expert. He is trusted by the Foreign Office to support their work overseas acting as a strategic adviser leading teams of international experts improving justice agencies.
Keith now wants to put all his experience to work for the communities of the Humberside Police area again, not reliving his operational days but using the insights gained during many years of success to create a new relationship between the police and the public, a real partnership.
He will:

Prioritise community policing, making it the heart of policing delivery
Pass more control to communities so they can direct what their officers deal with
Get PCC staff out on to the ground to check the reality of police delivery so no communities get left behind
Clearly speak up for the public, challenging police failures but also cuts to officer numbers
Involve police officers and staff meaningfully in building a force that responds to communities
Rebuild trust, confidence, effectiveness and morale.

The dramatic decline in Humberside’s policing over the last three years is a serious concern that affects you.   Government austerity cuts harmed an already under-resourced service leaving many residents feeling vulnerable and abandoned by Humberside Police. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary concluded that Humberside Police was both “Inadequate” and “Required Improvement.”  Other reports highlight low Police morale and poor detection rates in certain crimes.  Anti-social behaviour is rampant in some communities and the Police are reactive rather than preventative.
This situation needs reversing. Mike has the skills needed for an effective Police and Crime Commissioner.  Mike has successfully delivered public services before.   In the NHS, he managed large budgets and nearly 2000 staff who performed critical care and surgical operations on both sides of the Humber.  Mike now concentrates on his family business interests. He has a strong grasp of the issues and the political experience required too.
Other regions fought their corner for resources but Humberside has timidly closed police stations, downgraded services and decimated the idea of local policing.  Mike wants to change this by bringing back local policing to your area and securing the resources to ensure we have an effective Police Service that the public deserves. Follow Mike on his website.
A vote for Mike, is a vote for a return to an effective, local, common sense Police Service in Humberside.

The Home Office states PCCs… “must… take into account the need to: protect the UK border, critical infrastructure, civil nuclear sites, transport systems, and the public.” This is a serious role that requires an experienced person with the background, maturity and character to coordinate and lead the work of many organisations; to create one team and one set of goals to deliver public safety and security.
I am a former army officer, a former police officer and have held a number of senior policing, border security and diplomatic posts which you can read about at www.henrybolton.org. I have used my experience to improve security in a number of countries, including the US and Russia, and was made an OBE for services to international security.
As Kent PCC I will:

introduce Parish Constables with full police powers;
reduce road deaths;
strengthen the fight against terrorism, organised crime, cyber-crime, domestic and gender based violence;
strengthen border security;
reduce anti-social behaviour and create a support centre for those whose lives are blighted by it;
maintain present levels of support to victims of crime and sexual assaults;
work with local authorities and care providers to strengthen mental healthcare support to people at risk before there’s a need for the police to get involved;
apply pressure to bring comprehensive planning and transparency to Operation STACK;
Reduce unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles to joining the police;
oppose privatisation of law enforcement;
hold the government to account for the impact centrally imposed cuts have on the ability of the police to keep the people of Kent safe.

He is determined to rebuild public trust and confidence in the Force.
He will seek to cut central costs, including those of the Commissioner’s office and advisors, and he will refocus efforts on policing our neighbourhoods and communities. He will ruthlessly examine and reduce wasteful expenditure.
He will seek to reduce re-offending and will oppose the foolish closure of East Sutton Park Prison, with its very low re-offending rates.
He will continue to oppose the closure of the Courts in Dartford and Gravesham.
Above all he will work with the community to resolve our problems and to support Community Initiatives, such as the extension of 20 MPH limits, as well as working with Local Authorities to improve and modernise our outdated CCTV systems, and seek a viable alternative to Operation Stack.
He will allow the PCSO’s throughout Kent to be more effective by increasing their powers to allow them to do more to support the Police Force.
Dave will give higher priority to the needs and concerns of the victims of crime and to the need to prevent crime occurring.
Finally he will push the Government to recognise that Kent is on an international border and cannot be expected to shoulder the disproportionate expense of this without greater government help.

I was raised in Kent and have a background as a warranted Police Officer. I have the experience as a Kent-based councillor with responsibility for scrutiny of Policing and Community safety in Medway. I was formerly a Special Constable.
Under this Tory government we have seen since 2010:

£61m cut from Kent Police and a further £33m to be cut to 2019/20.
540 front line officers and 600 support staff cut.
10% cut in PCSOs.
Response times up a third.
Knife crime up 50%.
Neighbourhood policing undermined.

You have a choice on whether you want more of the same – or – someone who will stand up, not stand by. Only with a Labour team in Parliament, and PCCs across our country, can we challenge cuts to Kent Police.
Labour has a clear alternative:

Stand up for Kent against Home Office cuts to the Police force.
Support Victim Support Services and promote education and advocacy on issues like domestic abuse, rape and mental health.
Double the number of Kent Special Constables
Tighten up on Alcohol and other Licenses
Oppose back-door Tory privatisation
Speak up for our rural and farming communities who have suffered most from Police number cuts
Improve CCTV provision
Ensure Kent Police are responsive to PACTs, Parish Councils and Community Groups
Support Speed Watch
Listen and engage with the Police Federation, Fire Brigades Union, Unison and hardworking staff
Promote Community Payback and Victim-led restorative justice
Promote diversity – challenge racism, homophobia and other Hate Crime
Improve digital transformation and engagement. Draft a county-wide response to threat of Business Cybercrime.

Vote Labour on May 5th.

I am the County Chair of the Kent Police Independent Advisory Group, Vice Chair of the Kent Police and Crime Panel and a member of the Kent Youth Justice Board.  I have scrutinised the work of Kent Police for 17 years representing the issues and concerns raised by members of the public, acting as a community advocate – something which is integral to this role.
We live in challenging times with national and international issues such as the counter terrorism threat, Operation Stack and public order disturbances having a direct impact on us and the work of Kent Police. It is essential the Commissioner represents the views and challenges our residents face and to also ensure Kent Police deliver on their mission of providing a first class service protecting and serving the people of Kent.
 
My priorities are to:

Invest in Policing by putting extra officers in frontline services on the streets of Kent and to make smarter use of technology and training
Keeping Our Communities Safe
Local Solutions for Local Communities
Supporting local businesses by giving Kent Police the resources and technology required to tackle cyber-crime, theft and fraud effectively
Tackling Rural Crime
Create a volunteer Police Cadet programme for young people of Kent and increase the number of specials and expand the scope of their work and visibility

My six point plan will deliver the positive changes that Kent and Medway needs in all of our urban, rural and coastal areas.
The job of a PCC is to make sure people’s priorities for policing in their area are listened to, taken seriously, and acted upon by the Police. Throughout my career in public service, I have developed the experience required to support people through the Police and justice system, hold Ministers and public officials to account and make decisions about how resources are allocated. Coming from a Police family, I understand not only what Officers need to get the job done, but what they go through in the line of duty to protect us all.
As Commissioner, I will work hard to cut crime and reduce re-offending in all parts of the county. I want to make sure that victims are at the heart of the justice system and get the support they need. I shall look at how we can deliver a better service and value for money by developing the relationship with other emergency services.
I want to increase visible policing on our streets and support neighbourhood teams. Action is required to tackle the harm caused by anti-social behaviour, abuse and violence and substance misuse. I shall work with communities on solutions to the misery caused by Operation Stack. I will promote better online security to prevent cyber crime. I also want to revolutionise the approach to mental health, which is taking up more Police time.
For a safer community, lower crime and better accountability, I hope you will vote for me to be your Police and Crime Commissioner on Thursday 5th May.

Steve is a consultant project manager, with a huge experience of working in the public sector and therefore has the ideal qualifications and experience to lead and mange Kent’s Police far more effectively than has happened to date.
Steve has some new ideas that will make a big difference in ensuring that Law Abiding citizens are protected from Criminals, and in assisting in the proper enforcement of England’s Border Control in Kent, that fall within Kent Police’s jurisdiction.
The English Democrats have a range of Common Sense policies which if implemented would re-focus Police in Kent on traditional English Law & Order to Protect us all.

I have two children, Jack and Jessica.
My interests are politics, the outdoors, Scandi noir and chess.
I have no professional connections with the legal and law enforcement agencies. I will approach the role through the belief that policing should be democratic and impartial. I have known a number of police officers personally and I understand their priorities.
I view the role of Police and Crime Commissioner as reflecting the priorities and concerns of the residents of Lancashire. That must apply in both urban and rural communities, negating the poor perception of safety and working against all the challenges and government cuts to make safety a reality.
The police should listen to the views of residents: if elected, my role will be to represent those views. The police are drawn from the citizenry and are their public servants.
Cutting bureaucracy, reducing target/quota-driven policing, consistently monitoring efficiency savings and investing in new technologies would greatly improve morale amongst our hardworking officers.
Voting for me, as an experienced UKIP candidate (I have previously fought two elections in Lancashire), means impartiality and belief in the democratic process. Also I would not be claiming expenses and would donate part of my salary to local Child Protection and Women’s Refuge Charities.
I can deliver a balanced, ethical and inclusive concept that Lancashire deserves in 2016. Older parties are burdened with central edicts whilst I would deliver a more pragmatic independent approach based on common sense.
Vote for real modern ideas. Vote for James Barker.

Since the Conservatives came to power in 2010 their cuts have led to the loss of over 900 police officers and 700 police staff in Lancashire alone. These cuts will continue. In spite of this I have worked closely with the Chief Constable to ensure that neighbourhood policing has been protected and we provide an efficient and effective service. I have cut bureaucracy, ended meaningless targets and invested in new technology. This has been recognised by the HMIC as we are rated as ‘outstanding’ for efficiency and use of resources as well as for our engagement with communities.
The government’s proposed changes to the way funding is allocated would have penalised Lancashire for our success. Their proposals would have reallocated the equivalent of 600 Lancashire police officer jobs to other forces. I challenged the government, launched the ‘cut the cuts’ campaign, signed a letter threatening legal action and, with the support of the people of Lancashire, made them think again. They tried this again in the annual settlement but, again, I fought hard and won a far better outcome.
Your safety, and that of your family, is a serious business. The Conservatives are out of touch and don’t understand how devastating the cuts could have been for the people of Lancashire. I have steered the ship through some troubled waters and now face the future with some optimism. Lancashire is a great county, with a great police service. With your support I aim to make it the best force in the country.

Police and Crime Commissioners control a multi-million pound policing budget, have the power to hire and fire Chief Constables, and have a crucial role in ensuring the views of Lancashire residents are listened to when setting policing priorities. The position is incredibly important.
I served in Lancashire Police for over 30 years, starting out as a bobby on the beat, and rising through the ranks to become Superintendent. I want to use this track record and knowledge to make sure residents have a strong and effective force that will protect our communities.
I have a Five Point Plan that will make people living in Lancashire safer and more secure.
EFFICIENT POLICING I’ll get the greatest impact for every pound spent. Visible uniform patrols go a long way to reassure the public, helping to prevent and detect crime.   
SAFER STREETS I’ll bring the focus back on crime prevention; preventing the drug dealers, the drunkenness and the anti-social behaviour that can make areas difficult to live and work in.
PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE Young people and in particular those who are subject to sexual exploitation are extremely vulnerable. I pioneered work in this area in 2003 and I want to see it developed further.
TACKLING PREJUDICE This takes many forms, where people are abused and attacked because of their faith, race, sexual orientation or disability. I want to do more to get to the root of the causes and create a society where everyone is respected and valued.
COMMUNITY STRENGTH Residents who live and work in the county are key to police work. My priority is to strengthen and further develop this, particularly in areas and communities that have been distant at times from the police.

I will not just disappear into my office.”
Graham Roach’s six-point plan for better policing:

Local neighbourhood policing. It’s about local knowledge and an intelligence based approach to beating crime, not just walking the streets.
Keeping a separate police force for Lancashire. We’d be sidelined if we joined up with a larger less efficient force in Manchester or Merseyside would.
Information to the public. Graham will work with the Chief Constable to issue a weekly Bulletin via social media, the local press and a range of local channels.
The Police Commissioner should be a watchdog checking the police are working efficiently and appropriately, helping people to keep an eye on police performance and raise concerns. Members of the public should be involved in this work.
Sufficient resources for the public to easily access the police when they are needed, including a good non emergency (101) phone service.
Fighting for resources. Lancashire is being starved of what it needs to police the County properly. “As Commissioner I will lead the campaign via all parties and groups for more resources from Government.”

“I will work closely with Lancashire’s all party Police and Crime Panel to scrutinise and get best value from policing. The role of the Police Commissioner must be fully open and accountable”.
Graham Roach is an engineer, lives in Colne, was last year’s Mayor of Pendle and stood for the Liberal Democrats in Pendle at the General Election.
Graham opposes the police commissioner taking over the fire service.

I believe I have the knowledge and experience to do the job in a sensible, inclusive and innovative manner for the benefit of all those who live in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.
I have lived in the City and County for over 40 years. I spent 25 years as a Criminal Law Barrister in Leicester working alongside the Police. I have been a Government Justice Minister and, recently, Shadow Attorney General sitting in the Shadow Cabinet. My entire career in Criminal Justice has taught me how to approach this important responsibility.
Efficient use of public money is vital, but the almost 20% of Central Government cuts to the Leicestershire Force, including a reduction of over 400 Police Officers, has been too great. In spite of valiant efforts by all concerned, such a large drop is bound to have resulted in some significant lessening in the Force’s ability to police this diverse area as it would wish. From the many conversations I have had, it is clear that the Public senses a lesser emphasis on Community and Neighbourhood policing. This would be my first priority. Only by working closely with the Community can the Police give that feeling of protection and security which is at the heart of best policing.
There is too much “Hidden Crime”, such as Domestic Violence, Hate Crime and Cyber Crime, which goes unreported, with victims receiving no redress. This would be a priority for me, as would Anti-Social Behaviour, something which adversely affects so many people’s lives.
The PCC’s role is to look after Public Interest, but can only do so if he/she always remains close to the many communities that make up our Policing Area.

I have lived in South Leicestershire for 24 years with my wife and two daughters. I qualified as a solicitor and have worked with the Crown Prosecution Service for over 20 years both as a District Crown Prosecutor and as a Crown Advocate. I worked closely with the police on many major investigations and remained independent, objective and fair. I bring substantial experience and knowledge in working with the police to make our communities safer.
As a District Councillor I know the benefits of working in partnership in order to achieve results. I look forward to building on partnerships with local authorities, health care providers, social services, community groups and the other emergency services to commission work to prevent offending. I will also support victims of crime and work hard to give them a greater say.
There are many threats to our safety and my task is to ensure the police are properly funded to protect us. I am determined to ensure the best value for money in our Police Force while investing in technology and sharing services and buildings with other emergency services. Savings made can then be used to maintain frontline policing.
As your Police and Crime Commissioner I will be accountable to you and will consult regularly with all communities to ensure your voice is heard by the police.
Every crime is important no matter where you live and the police should respond accordingly.

The most common complaint I hear about the police is how we don’t see them as much as we used to. Tory cuts to police numbers mean that they now focus on the most serious crimes, leaving less time to patrol locally.
People rightly expect the police to respond to low level crimes too. Vandalism, graffiti, speeding traffic and inconsiderate parking can make people’s lives a misery. I will ensure the Police give these crimes appropriate attention too.
The current Police and Crime Commissioner’s office costs a staggering £1 million a year. I will slash these costs and put the money directly into frontline policing.
I want to revolutionise neighbourhood watch. By getting volunteers trained and organised they can be visible and collect vital intelligence which the police can use to prosecute criminals.
All emergency services and local authorities should be working together to tackle the social and mental health problems that drive much criminal behaviour.
As a local Councillor for over 14 years and vice chair of the former Police Authority, I have the experience and knowledge to do the job.
My main priorities will be:

Get back to basics of policing. By ensuring a more visible police presence on our streets I will work to stamp out the low level crimes that cause daily misery in many of our communities.
Revolutionise Neighbourhood Watch to make it more effective in tackling crime.
Working with other organisations to tackle the causes of crime.
Slash the cost of the Police and Crime Commissioner’s office.

With your support I’ll work for a police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

David is married and has three grown up children, he has lived in Leicestershire for the majority of his life. David has achieved a number of personal goals including receiving a post graduate certificate in local governance from the South Bank University. 
David is recognised for setting strategy and delivering significant savings while protecting front line services. He has previously worked with the police and helped launch the innovative ‘Keep Safe Cards’ designed for vulnerable people across the force area. This project highlighted the need to work jointly across agencies with people with mental health needs. 
David believes experience shows that the best form of reassurance policing is having beat teams as part of the community – having boots on the ground helps tackle anti-social behavior and persistent offending. The Leicestershire police force, like other police forces across the country, has seen its Government grant slashed leaving them with a challenging budget. We need to look at innovative ways to save money while protecting front line services. Quickly moving forward on sharing services with other forces across the East Midlands is one way we could do this. After all, criminals do not recognise county borders.

I believe living among the people I represent is essential to do a good job.
I began my working life as a Barrister then had a business career. My adult sons were educated in Lincolnshire and my teenage son is at school in Horncastle. Now as a mother and local Councillor I have a real interest in ensuring the best possible policing for everyone in Lincolnshire.
The police should not be politicised and should be independent-minded. Your Police and Crime Commissioner needs to be answerable to the residents and not some establishment political hierarchy. I can offer you this with UKIP as I can work for you without fear or favour from anyone while still being part of a strong lobbying force to get Lincolnshire a better financial deal. Policing cannot be done on the cheap, and while volunteers offer a lot to our force, they cannot plug the gaps left by lack of funding for full time Officers and PCSOs.
I believe that there should be zero tolerance to crime and anti-social behaviour. Crime is not a lifestyle option. People should feel safe and be safe, and visible policing is the way to do this. Nothing can replace uniformed presence on the beat with better use of PCSOs. All crime should be recorded and reporting of crime made easier to build trust and confidence in our policing.
If I am elected I will meet regularly with residents and ensure the Chief Constable is held to account, bringing as much transparency and accountability to the office as possible.

I have worked in business for a number of years and am also an Executive County Councillor currently overseeing a £1 billion budget which includes fire and rescue services, highways, children’s services and adult care.
Setting and balancing the budget is a vital task for our Police and Crime Commissioner. I understand the need to spend public money wisely and to drive out inefficiency rather than cut front line services.
On Thursday 5th May I hope you will back my 6 point plan for policing and crime in Lincolnshire:
• Introduce ‘community constables’ to boost visible neighbourhood policing by recruiting local people with powers of arrest to work at the heart of our communities.
• Focus on crime prevention by spotting the warning signs of potential issues in our communities early to reduce the number of victims of crime and the fear of crime.
• Deal with rural crime seriously so that issues such as hare coursing, theft of livestock, machinery, tools, vehicles and stock do not damage our local economy and put local jobs at risk.
• Clean up our streets with a tough approach to street drinking, fly-tipping, litter and excess noise which are a blight on our towns and communities.
• Treat victims of crime compassionately with better support and effective aftercare. Being a victim of crime is bad enough without feeling used by the system.
• Spend taxpayers’ money wisely leaving more for front line policing. Over £165,000 was wasted on the unnecessary suspension of Lincolnshire’s Chief Constable in 2013.

I’ve lived in Lincolnshire all my life, working full-time in teaching for fourteen years including in school management for the past nine. Through my job I understand the need to deliver high standards efficiently and effectively. I know the importance of setting out a clear vision for what I wish to achieve and carefullly monitoring progress towards carefully defined strategic objectives.
I’m committed to neighbourhood policing and preventing anti-social behaviour so that people feel safe on the streets. I’m determined to tackle rural crime – we deserve effective policing whether we live in a town, a village or on a farm. Protecting the most vulnerable in our society, including older people, children and victims of domestic abuse, is also vital. Working with children has shown me that one of the best ways to cut crime is to stop crime happening in the first place which is why I’ll be developing further links between schools and the police to support children making the right choices.
Protecting frontline policing, including PCSOs, is vital. We need to cut crime, not police. I’ll halt any further privatisation of police services, so we’re not putting even more of Lincolnshire taxpayers’ hard-earned money into the hands of big corporations. The force needs more resources, not fewer, so I’ll be fighting for a fairer funding formula.   With the increase in cyber crime and online fraud we need a police force that’s able to tackle 21st century challenges. Above all, people need to feel safe and secure in their homes and on the streets where they live and that is what I’ll be focused on.

FEET ON THE STREET            
ZERO TOLERANCE ON REPEAT OFFENDERS & ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
TACKLE RURAL CRIME
SUPPORT THE VICTIM OF CRIME
Crime is a blight on our communities and can be devastating for victims.
As the Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire I would work without prejudice or political favour to ensure the police respond to what local people want.
The six biggest problem areas facing our county are:

Drug addiction and dealing.
Repeat offenders and anti-social behaviour.
Rural crime and lack of availability of officers and resources to tackle rural crime.
Weapons and violent crime.
The poor relationship between public and police.
Unreported crime.

I would ensure that the force has effective strategies to tackle all of them.
I would introduce:

a “what works” initiative, so that we learn from the best initiatives both locally and across the country; and
a major review of administrative costs so that frontline policing is protected wherever possible.

I would also:
Consider devolving part of the budget to parish councils so they can respond to what they see as their key priorities.
Hold regular events and consultation with local residents and other organisations such as businesses to ensure that both myself and the police are accountable and deliver what you want.

Engage with young people by having an approachable police presence available for schools, colleges and their wider community.
Challenge the local Crown Prosecution Service and criminal Justice system over decisions that clearly undermine the work of the Lincolnshire Police and public confidence in them.
Challenge our local MPs and senior politicians to finally stand up for Lincolnshire to get fair funding for our police, for victim support and rehabilitation schemes that prevent reoffending.

However, the most important post is the one I am applying for now, that of Merseyside’s Police and Crime Commissioner. This is not just a wish to get back into the policing world but a genuine belief that the communities of Merseyside have not felt their police force has prioritised their needs in recent years.
Each year thousands of residents and businesses lose large sums of money through hackers and scammers who prey on their trust. More sinister too are the threats from paedophile gangs. I will ensure Merseyside is a hostile environment for those seeking to harm our children and vulnerable people.
It is clear to many people that the police have retreated from our streets. One of my first decisions will be to redress this by making all officers available for front-line duties. I don’t want to see any ‘forgotten’ areas in Merseyside; we all deserve access to sensible levels of policing.
I believe a re-organisation of current resources is more important than increasing council tax and guarantee we can get more out of our police force without necessarily putting more money in.
Local police and fire services work well together. As Police and Crime Commissioner I will merge much of their work, saving money to put where it is needed most: protecting law-abiding citizens and arresting criminals.
My priority will always be to make Merseyside safer for the law-abiding and hostile to the criminal.

Chris was elected as a Liberal Democrat Councillor in Wirral in 2014 – where he lives with his wife and daughter. Chris has spent over 35 years working in electrical engineering and I.T. management both in the UK and abroad.
Chris’s priorities for Merseyside are:
– Maintain a visible presence by defending front line policing
 
– Protect neighbourhood policing and fully support our PCSOs
 
– Ensure swift and effective response to reports of anti-social behaviour
 
– Prioritise tackling domestic violence and sexual exploitation
 
– Champion the rights of the victims and the use of restorative justice
 
“I am standing for Merseyside’s Police and Crime Commissioner to work hard and make Merseyside the best police force in the country.
Policing faces many funding challenges and I believe this post needs a fresh, practical approach. One that is not influenced by existing culture.
I believe to be effective in this role you need to listen to residents of Merseyside. The Commissioner should be the voice of the community within the police force – not the police force’s voice in the community.
With your support on May 5th I’ll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police force that will help keep you and your family safe.”

The toll of killed and seriously injured across Merseyside remains high.
I would call on the police to tackle road danger as a key priority, with challenging targets. If needed, I would propose an increase in the police precept to provide resources for road policing.
Other police priorities are widely agreed, such as action on serious and organised crime, domestic abuse, hate crime, burglary, violent crime, support for victims, tackling antisocial behaviour and supporting neighbourhood policing.
As a city councillor from 2002 until 2015, I worked alongside the neighbourhood policing team in my ward, gaining insights into the value of local policing. To make neighbourhood policing more effective and more visible, I would encourage police to use cycles rather than cars for non-emergency patrols.
The illegal drug trade fuels the gun and gang culture on Merseyside: the police and the community need to act against it. The PCC should speak to government about its failure to either reconsider the need for drugs to continue to be illegal or else provide adequate funding to deal with the consequences.
In the meantime, resources should not be wasted punishing people with a medical condition which they manage by cultivating a few cannabis plants.
The PCC should build trust between every part of the public and the police. I would monitor and review local policing to make sure the police were not seen to be acting in an oppressive way against any element of the public, such as ethnic minorities or vulnerable people, particularly the homeless or those in fear of eviction.

I am asking the people of Merseyside to re-elect me as their Police Commissioner on 5th May.
The Tories have cut police budgets hard and areas like Merseyside have lost a huge number of jobs. Since 2010 we have lost 1600 police officers and staff due to the Tories savage cuts. I fought hard to stop them from cutting the Force even further and thanks to a strong public response last October, over 16,000 people signed my petition in just two weeks.
As a result of public pressure George Osborne promised to stop any further cuts and so we can save our PCSOs, our mounted unit and neighbourhood patrols along with a wide range of other services which were under threat. I am in no doubt that if I had not challenged him about the cuts and if Merseysiders had ignored my petition, we would be in grave danger of reducing the police force to a ‘blue light’ only emergency service.
But there is something to celebrate. In spite of being one of the hardest hit by Tory cuts Merseyside Police have been judged to be one of the best performing metropolitan police forces in England by the independent police inspectorate, HMIC.
As Merseyside Police Commissioner I will:

Work hard with the Chief Constable to maintain this outstanding performance
Build even better services for the victims of crime
Work hard to make our roads safer for all
Fight against further cuts to the police budget

With the support of the people of Merseyside I can do this and more. That is why I am seeking re-election on May 5th 2016.

Why re-elect Stephen?
Stephen is the only candidate in Norfolk with significant experience of police administration. He is also independent of any political party – “Policing Not Politics”
Under his leadership:

Norfolk Constabulary rated ‘Outstanding’ in November 2014 by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and ‘Good’ in other HMIC inspections
The Commissioner’s Office has saved £1.4m since November 2012 in administration costs against the cost of the old Police Authority and this money has gone back into front line policing
The PCC and Chief Constable have overseen efficiency savings of £13.8m since November 2012 whilst keeping Norfolk as one of the safest places in the UK
Re-offending and Anti-Social Behaviour is down
Norfolk has pioneered initiatives such as mental health experts based in the Police Control Room
Norfolk has undertaken nationally recognised work with charities and ex-service personnel organisations to prevent crime
Through Operations Randall and Radar rural crime has declined year on year with only egg theft and coursing seeing slight increases
There has been a focus on victims of crime with GP surgeries across the county being trained in how to spot domestic violence and sexual abuse early
Norfolk supports the rehabilitation of offenders coming out of prison to stop the cycle of re-offending and is looking to find employers in Norfolk to utilise their skills
Norfolk is the only PCC’s office tasked by the Home Secretary to distribute money to charities countrywide regarding child sexual abuse
Norfolk Constabulary was the first force to complete the mental health concordat in the country
Norfolk remains statistically the safest county in the country

 She knows what Norfolk needs from a Police and Crime Commissioner!
 Since moving to Norfolk in 1996 Jacky has been very active in the local community serving on North Norfolk District Council and the County Council.
At district level she was instrumental in setting up, and then Chairing, the North Norfolk Housing Trust. Now Victory Housing, this has transformed the housing of its tenants, spending millions on bringing their homes up to modern standards, and building much needed new affordable homes.
As a County Councillor, she was Deputy Leader of the Lib Dem Group and served on the Adult Social Services, Audit, Health Overview and Scrutiny Committees.
Current Issues 
 Jacky is campaigning to:

Increase attention on unreported crimes, e.g. domestic and sexual violence.
Tackle local and international gangs involved in drugs and human trafficking.
Take on the threat of ever-increasing cyber-crime.
Reduce the time wasted by the police on data handling.
Halt the loss of much needed PCSOs.
Develop joint working with neighboring counties – Suffolk and Cambridgeshire.
Further the use of restorative justice to reduce re-offending.

 A Message from Jacky
 “I believe the key role of the Police and Crime Commissioner is to ensure that the relationship between the community and its Police Force is one of clarity, excellent communication and, above all, trust.
My knowledge of the community through my political career, my earlier experience as a banker and management consultant and my wholesale support for Norfolk’s Constabulary makes me the ideal candidate for this important role. Liberal Democrats believe in a fair and even handed society. Our time in Coalition proved that – our absence from Government over the last year clearly demonstrates it!

I worked with many agencies including the Police, Probation, MAPPA panels and Victim Liaison, and have experience of the criminal justice system from many perspectives.
As a front line service the Police are often the first point of contact for people with mental disorder. 20% of police time is currently spent dealing with mental health issues, but there is not enough inter-agency co-operation to make sure that vulnerable people get the help they need. If elected I would make joined-up services for mental health a key strategic priority to free up Police time for their core functions.
In government Labour introduced Neighbourhood Policing and provided 17,000 additional Police Officers and 16,000 PCSOs. 6 years of David Cameron has seen those posts slashed – 18,000 posts lost and £2 million cut from Norfolk’s budget next year, while crime has risen by 12% locally. No-one wants a politicised Police Service but only through politics can we challenge the decisions that are devastating our Police Service.
I am standing in this election because Labour’s values of equality, social justice and co-operation should be at the heart of policing our communities. It is the most disadvantaged and socially excluded that are disproportionately the victims of crime and are also least able to protect themselves against its consequences. From Magna Carta to the Human Rights Act it has been the rule of law that limits the power of the few and protects the rights of the many.  Please support me in campaigning for a Police and Crime Commissioner who reflects those values.

Working as a Metropolitan Police Detective for 20 years means that I have a thorough understanding of policing issues and problems to bring to bear on my duties as a Police and Crime Commissioner. So my intention once elected will be to take time to learn the mechanics of a PCC’s duties before exercising the powers available to me. Then to the best of my abilities I will carry out my duties.
Key points that I will keep uppermost in my focus will be:

Record ALL crime
Be visible, approachable and alert to the communities I serve
Invest in local initiatives in accordance with community concerns including support for ‘Zero Tolerance’
Incorporate cost-effective new technology where practicable
Ensure more representation of the community on key policing issues and maintain regular communications between the police and the people
Guarantee transparency and public scrutiny through performance monitoring of the police in compliance with an agreed Local Police & Crime Plan

Taxpayers rightly expect their police forces to allocate their resources, including finance, to the most pressing needs of communities ensuring that all are protected from crime however it might manifest itself.
I recognize that as a PCC I must “think out of the box” and keep abreast of new technologies and approaches to improve policing. New technology has the potential to deliver cost savings, meaning more money for redeployment of uniformed Police at a community level. I want warranted officers to be doing real police work and be visible “on the street” or in the local community, not doing back office work.",https://www.choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/norfolk/david-john-moreland/

Having spoken to thousands of local residents, I feel I have some understanding of what the priorities of the Police and Crime Commissioner should be.
As a result, if elected I would take measures to:

Ensure that there are fewer police cuts especially to the Police and Community Support Officers (PCSOs) who act on a daily basis as the important link between the community and the constabulary.


Tackle the bureaucratisation and politicisation of the police force.


Make more money available for small grants to community projects which improve safety in their local area.


Protect rural policing and ensure that resources are not solely focused on the county’s towns and cities.


Encourage the establishment of more neighbourhood watch schemes, especially in rural areas.


Hold regular “surgeries” and events across the county to ensure that residents are able to contact their PCC more easily and get to know me.


Ensure that more is done to tackle “hidden” crime, e.g. domestic violence, which is often under-or-unreported

Most importantly though, I would like to hear from more residents in Norfolk to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard. After all, it is only through working together that we can make this county safer for all.

Arfon is a Wrexham Councillor and currently chairs the Community Health Council in Wrexham.
“As Police Commissioner my first job would be to carry out a review of core policing in North Wales. There are indications that over 60% of Police work is work that other agencies should be doing.
“Savings could be made by targeting resources more effectively, i.e. Youth Justice does excellent work but better resourcing could see them intervening earlier and diverting young people away from crime.
“A lot of money is wasted by arresting the most vulnerable in society. Jailing homeless veterans is self defeating. We need better partnership working to support the vulnerable.
“I will also campaign for better policing of protests and sporting events. Policing of such events does not always seem to be as impartial or proportionate as it should be.
“There should be more emphasis on roads policing to reduce those killed or seriously injured, particularly amongst young people.
“I would provide all frontline officers with ‘Body Worn Videos’ which would improve evidence gathering and secure more convictions, especially in ‘domestic violence’ cases. It would help resolve complaints against police.
“I would also pledge not to outsource police services and ensure that tendering for services benefits the economy of North Wales as far as is practicable.
“Finally, I would liaise closely and seek to negotiate with the National Offender Management Service regarding policing issues around the new prison in Wrexham.

Julian Sandham,https://1rbena1k2rviaenzl3kexmgl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Julian-Sandham.jpg,Independent/Annibynnol,,"For over two years, I was the Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner and this, combined with my previous experience as a Divisional Commander and Head of Criminal Justice qualifies me for the position. Due to my experience, I am the person best placed to hold the Chief Constable to account and to support the work of the police to ensure effectiveness for the people of North Wales.  I have a track record of delivery.  The recent achievement I am most proud of was leading the work which culminated in the setting up of the North Wales Victim Help Centre.   I began my police career on the beat in Bangor.  I was a police officer in North Wales for over 33 years, the last nine of which were as a Chief Superintendent.
I am not a member of a political party. If elected, I will represent you independent of party politics. I have no other allegiances – I will put the people of North Wales first every time.
My manifesto commitment is to work to ensure that people are secure in their homes and safe in public places. I want us to work together to have the safest communities it is possible to have.
If elected, I will: maintain a modern policing service, protect and help vulnerable people, prioritise neighbourhood policing, encourage effective partnerships and listen to what people tell me and act upon their concerns.
I understand policing. I want to maintain a visible police presence and the police stations we have across North Wales.  I intend to campaign against the risk of further cuts.

I’m putting myself forward because North Wales needs a new crime plan and a Commissioner who supports officers on the frontline but is not part of the establishment.
I am honest about my politics and honest about the direction I will bring to the role:
CRACK DOWN ON ANTI SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
I’ll do everything I can to keep policing visible and bring back the local bobby. More police and PCSOs on the streets make people feel safe and deter crime.
WAR ON DRUGS AND TRAFFICKING BY MANCHESTER AND MERSEYSIDE GANGS
Drugs are a huge problem in many of our towns and the A55 is being used for trafficking. I want the police to get tough on dealers who are blighting communities.
ZERO TOLERANCE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE
Failures of different agencies to share information has meant missed opportunities to protect vulnerable people in North Wales. I’ll introduce better training and work more closely with others to identify victims earlier.
PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM SCAMS, FRAUDSTERS AND CYBERCRIME
I’ll crack down on criminals who prey on older people – whether door-to-door, on the phone or online – and I’ll create a North Wales Cyber School to help younger people guard against being exploited online.
SMARTER ROAD SAFETY
I’ll work with Community Speed Watch groups to improve road safety and I’ll review how cameras are used to best effect – I want to end the perception of unfairness in how speed controls are enforced.
A COMMISSIONER FOR EVERYONE
I’ll make services more accessible. If a distressed person wants to report a crime in Welsh then they should get access to a fellow Welsh speaker immediately. I’ll establish a new Countryside Crime Taskforce to improve rural policing.

I feel privileged to live and work in North Wales.
I attended Bishop Grosseteste University Lincoln and trained as a teacher and received my postgraduate qualification (PGCE) through Nottingham Trent University. I taught in a residential unit before switching careers to become a police officer.
I returned to education and training, setting up my own training consultancy and worked in colleges, business training departments, the corporate sector as well as welfare to work and a range of other sectors.
Having seen the very best and the very worse of police culture I realise that if policing by consent is to be preserved here in the UK, things must radically change. Public image and public trust in our police are paramount and, therefore, I believe in a zero tolerance approach to dishonesty and corruption which seriously undermine the image and status of honest, professional and hardworking police officers and the police service.
I would pledge to ensure that people of North Wales have a police force that acts as public servants but command respect through professionalism, respect, integrity and honesty through all ranks. I would:-

Give a 100% commitment to the role, not holding any other professional appointments/paid positions.
Be accessible to the public to listen to your views on policing. To be visible, approachable and alert to the community.
Develop a police and crime plan which addresses your community needs and priorities.
Ensure community representation on key issues and communication between public and police.
Address key public frustrations of reporting and recording all crimes.
Seek ways to be cost effective, innovative and efficient.

We already have a Chief Constable and excellent senior police officers. This role is about electing a public representative to champion public priorities for policing within tight budgets.
I live at Nannerch in Flintshire and have 28 years business and management experience to director level including as a senior consultant in the defence sector. I have been a county councillor in Flintshire for 12 years where I was a cabinet member for Economic Development and led on regeneration initiatives. I have worked closely with community organisations, including areas of deprivation, such as West Rhyl, as well as supporting neighbourhood watch schemes.
I have chaired and been on the board of directors of a number of public and private organisations in North Wales and have excellent contacts in the UK Government and Welsh Assembly.
I will ensure there is an effective, experienced team working with MPs, AMs and councillors, delivering:
Safer communities – more visible frontline officers on the beat with less bureaucracy and special constables for every town and village that wants one.
Safety partnerships – prioritise agencies working together effectively and making wise use of joint resources.
Safer homes and businesses – invest in technology and education to reduce danger online and improve measures against fraud and business crime.
Support for victims – increased support for victims to help them rebuild their lives and ensure offenders right their wrongs with a particular emphasis on drug rehabilitation and mental health issues.
National Security – with Holyhead port and major transport links I will ensure robust security and joint working on terrorism and international crime.

Despite his promises, the Tory Chancellor is cutting national funding for our police forces by £160m. I will fight these cuts as they will inevitably lead to fewer police officers.
Here in North Yorkshire I have three priorities:
• Visible Policing: Many people have told me that they rarely see the police in their communities. I will make sure that local police officers meet with neighbourhood and community organisations to listen to and address their concerns. I will reduce the number of staff in the Commissioner’s office, which has nearly doubled since the old Police Authority, and use savings to protect frontline officers.
• Professional Policing: Professional development for our police officers is vitally important. Once qualified, a Constable can go through most of their career without any further training. This is despite the changing face of crime. I will introduce regular training for officers to address new laws and innovative crime-fighting techniques.
• Evidence-led Policing: We need our police to concentrate on measures that will address crime and the fear of crime. I will lead community and restorative justice initiatives that will allow victims of crime a say and bring criminals face-to-face with the consequences of their actions.
I have worked for a number of regional companies and organisations in senior communications and campaigning roles. I want to be a different kind of Police and Crime Commissioner – listening to and available for local residents. With your support on May 5th I’ll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police force that will keep you and your family safe.

As a Frontline Firefighter I have first-hand experience how the cuts to frontline emergency services are having a detrimental impact on the quality of service provided to the communities of North Yorkshire.
I have witnessed first-hand how the views of the Public get ignored by key decision makers.
None of this is acceptable to me, this is why I’m standing for the office of Police and Crime Commissioner. The people of North Yorkshire deserve a strong and determined voice who will deliver an effectively resourced police force, there to protect you and your family.
I believe the Government and PCC should cut crime, not the police. I will protect and improve the frontline making sure our police are equipped with the resources they need to fight crime in a vast, rural county such as ours in the 21st Century.
I have a track record of successfully campaigning for the best for the people I represent.

Policing is changing. The next 4 years will be vital and we need an experienced PCC with a record of fighting North Yorkshire’s corner, as well as delivering improvements locally. My priorities are:
Boost the frontline – following the announcement to protect police budgets, I will increase officer numbers to 1,400 and Police Community Support Officers to 200.
Protecting vulnerable people – as well as £3.2m to better protect vulnerable people including children, older people and victims of domestic and sexual abuse, I will ring-fence £600,000 for mental health crisis care to support people in contact with the police.
More support for rural communities – I will roll out ‘Community Speed Watch’ in villages and local communities wishing to participate. I will support the new Rural Crime Task Force across all rural areas and increase collaboration to better tackle serious and cross-border crime.
Saving money, protecting services via blue-light collaboration – this is common sense. I will share more buildings, back-office administration and governance, to save money and help protect frontline services.
Improve the ‘101’ service – based on my independent review, I will improve the ‘101’ service. I will upgrade the phones so you can get hold of the people you need and improve access to local police by putting contact details on a new police website.
Speaking up for North Yorkshire at the heart of government – I have a track record of speaking out for North Yorkshire and will continue to ensure your voice is heard via my work at a national level. In particular, I will continue my fight for fair funding for rural forces.

He is North Yorkshire born and bred. He is not affiliated to any political party and believes that a Police and Crime Commissioner should be entirely locally independent and unencumbered from any political allegiance or influence.
A Police and Crime Commissioner is entrusted by the public to hold the Chief Constable to account for the delivery of policing. To do this credibly it is an advantage to have an in depth knowledge and understanding of policing. This will support their judgement and provide them with the insight to effectively challenge the Chief Constable on behalf of the public.
In his view the past four years of government cuts, together with poor local decision making has been a disaster for policing North Yorkshire. It has, in his opinion, led to the reduced visible presence of police officers, the inefficient and negligent use of public money and a critical reduction in public confidence of our police and the role of the PCC.
The reason I am standing is because I care passionately about safeguarding my county and our police service.
As North Yorkshire’s Independent Police and Crime Commissioner I will bring a local approach to policing priorities and focus on the real issues and concerns of the communities who live here. As an Independent PCC with an instinctive understanding of policing only I can provide the service you deserve, free from political spin and partisan agenda. Please help me to make policing work again in North Yorkshire. Use your vote on 5th of May to keep politics out of policing.

As a qualified lawyer, I’m intimately familiar with the police and wider criminal justice system. And as a parliamentary candidate in Northampton last year, criminal justice issues were high on my agenda.
We’ve lost over 100 police officers and PCSOs in the county since 2010 and the government wants to cut our police force by a further 10% by 2020. As your PCC I’ll work with colleagues in Parliament to secure a better deal for policing – ensuring we get the protection we deserve.
I’ll cut the cost of the office PCC here in Northants. Out will go the legions of spinners and advisers and in will come more uniforms on our streets. Those extra officers will help to stem the rising tide of violent crime, which has doubled over the past two years, soaring to levels seen in the inner city estates of London and Manchester.
I’ll prioritise the protection of our county’s young people from exploitation, ensuring no stone is left unturned in ensuring the grooming scandals of recent years are not repeated in our county’s towns and villages.
And I’ll be a PCC who focuses solely on policing, criminal justice, victims and witness services, bringing back the Hate Crimes Unit to help those communities marginalised in recent years. On day one in office I’ll do everything in my power to halt the sale of Wootton Hall, part of a ridiculous free school vanity project, and stop the closure of Kettering and Corby police stations.
Under my leadership together we’ll fight crime and protect Northants.

Northamptonshire deserves a strong Police and Crime Commissioner with the right experience that listens to you, who will set out the right policing priorities over the next four years.
As an experienced businessman and a father of three I wanted to see a Safer and more secure Northamptonshire, I have the skills needed to oversee a £120 million pound organisation and 2,000 staff and police officers. I understand how important the role of the Commissioner is, I believe we have a dedicated police force and I trust them. I will do all in my power to protect, and if possible, increase frontline police numbers.
I have been listening to the views of many residents and believe I understand what matters most to you and your family. I will clamp down on burglary and rural crime to ensure that victims get justice.
I will address the problem with alcohol and drug fuelled crime across our county, as well as working to end domestic violence. I want to make sure that our towns and villages are safe for our children and grandchildren, free from those who wish to harm them either physically or online.
Your priorities are my priorities and I will:
• Maintain frontline policing
• Tackle rural crime
• Keep victims at the heart of justice
• Clamp down on burglary
• Increase safety for our children
• Zero tolerance to domestic violence
You deserve a hands-on Commissioner, with the right skills, vision and experience to deliver your policing priorities. A powerful advocate, who understands and upholds the principals of law and order in Northamptonshire. This is why I am asking for your vote on Thursday 5th May.

I do not see the role of PCC as being political and will serve Northamptonshire with impartiality and transparency. I will put aside political agenda and resign as a Councillor if elected.
My main priorities are to tackle anti-social behaviour, rural crime, cybercrime and child exploitation. I also wish to bring a greater degree of public engagement to the role of PCC. I would like to see the return of community policing and will drastically cut OPCC spending.
I will seek the views of local residents so that they can help to ensure resources are put into tackling areas of crime that matter to them most. It is time for Northamptonshire Police to restore its links with our communities and focus on fighting crime as opposed to putting resources into pet projects and gimmicks.
It is time to get back to basics and fight crime head on through working in partnership.

I’ve worked hard to ensure that tackling Anti-social Behaviour remains high on the policing agenda.   Across Northumbria, police officers and partner organisations work to ensure the minority who cause problems know their behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.   Our work tackling ASB has been recognised by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary as being outstanding.   I have also ensured that Northumbria leads the way in tackling domestic abuse and violence.   A regional strategy has been implemented and police officers are better trained to offer support and advice to victims.
Neighbourhood policing is your and my number one priority, so I’ve brought police officers closer to you.   Police stations have been relocated to community hubs, making police officers more accessible.   All savings have been reinvested in policing.
I will always ensure that victims of crime remain at the heart of everything we do, and that they get the support they need.   I’m proud that we are getting it right: we have a satisfaction rate of 91%, the highest in the country – but I want this figure even higher.
Since 2010, successive Governments have cut more than £100 million from the Northumbria Police budget.   Despite this challenge, I will continue to ensure that your priorities are delivered by Northumbria Police.
Northumbria deserves the very best policing.   I have always tried to deliver this, and if re-elected I will continue to ensure effective policing is delivered for you and your family.   I hope I can count on your support.

Who currently works as a solicitor specialising in criminal law. His current profession means he has accumulated 40 years relevant experience giving him a unique perspective into policing; this makes him the best person for the job. This election transcends normal political affiliations; please elect the best person for the job. He would not need a highly paid deputy nor would he allow any political appointments in the Police & Crime Commissioners Office. The post must be made transparent.
In addition to his normal police experience he was an elected member of the police federation (the police equivalent to a union) at 3 different ranks representing the rank and file officers and dealing with police regulations.
Stewart is local in every sense of the word, he was born in the county has always lived and worked here. He has no plans to ever move away this makes him very aware of our local issues, and the cosmopolitan mix of our communities.
Main priorities: –
Protecting frontline and community policing. 
Engaging with the public which so far through surveys and face to face exchanges has confirmed his priority of frontline visible police presence is what the public want putting him in perfect harmony with constituents.
Embracing diversity not treating people the same but in accordance with their individual needs. 
Generating an atmosphere of respect between the police and public. 
Introduce innovation putting Northumbria Police at the forefront of policing.   
Create bespoke policing plan(s) catering for the differences between rural, town and city centre policing issues.

I am lucky enough to represent a party that will not pressure me into political decisions; I will make decisions that are right for our communities not the politicians.
I also have a sound working knowledge of enforcement legislative requirements and constraints in executing duties as well as experience of leading people and managing budgets, having previously worked in intelligence and enforcement as the manager of the National Identity Fraud Unit, then as the manager of a region-wide North East organised fraud team. I understand the competing priorities and demands encountered when trying to deliver government targets against a backdrop of budget reductions and staffing issues.
I would like to see more done for victims of sexual abuse, assault or exploitation, such as more accessible services for both children and adults to be able to report incidents through. I believe there’s a need for this type of service and that it could be developed and led by Northumbria Police Force working in conjunction with local authorities and other agencies to make this type of crime as easy to report as house burglary or common assault.
A vote for another party is a vote for more of the same party politics – but I believe it’s time for change and the only party that promises change is the UK Independence Party.

Police officers have a tough job and they need more support. The recent increase in council tax collected by the Northumbria Force must be spent on front line policing not bureaucracy.
I want to abolish the PCCs. They have been an expensive failed experiment. I’d rather have money spent on police officers than politicians and their offices.
The police are too often tied up in red tape. We need to free them from too much time stuck behind desks to spend more time on the streets.
I’ll also make sure we do more to stop re-offending. I will focus on rehabilitation and restorative justice so offenders pay back to victims and the local community. This would cut crime, save police time and taxpayers’ money.
Finally, more needs to be done to stop people becoming criminals. We should identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults before they fall into a life of crime.
I gave up paid employment 7 years ago to set up my own business and live the “good life” – growing my own food. This has given me a good insight into rural issues.
I am an experienced councillor, representing a partly rural, partly suburban area on Gateshead Council, which itself covers a mainly urban area. My experience gives me a good understanding of the different issues affecting Tyne and Wear and Northumberland.
I’ll use that experience to ensure we’re doing all we can to tackle the causes of crime.
With your support I’ll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

My decision to stand is partly driven by the concern I have about the proposed merger of the Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire County police divisions, currently widely unopposed and without public consultation.
The challenges facing policing in the city and county are very different. Over recent years, thanks to excellent partnership working between the police, local authorities, neighbourhood and community groups, crime in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire has dropped. This is because in each area there is someone ultimately accountable for policing. If the merger went ahead, Nottingham would be the only city of its size not to have a unique police division. No one wants us to fall behind other cities and return to the dark days over a decade ago with a reputation for gun crime and binge drinking.
If elected, I will review the salary of the commissioner and staff. The £75,000 annual commissioner salary would be halved and the £90,000 a year Chief Executive reviewed as this is unacceptable, especially as public sector cuts are harming front-line services and front-line policing.
Savings on my salary and current deputy would be spread amongst five deputies, representing all sections of the community including young people.
Most local people don’t know what the role of the commissioner is; I would communicate far better and give the community a bigger voice.
Vote for me on May 5th and I will fight for Nottinghamshire to have the policing it deserves.

Having served in the Police force for 36 years, he has experience in virtually every aspect of policing for example CID, roads policing, budget management, community relations and neighbourhood policing.
Tony’s four pledges are:

To improve neighbourhood policing 

As a retired senior police officer, he understands how important neighbourhood policing is to make sure people feel safe in their communities and to act as a deterrent of crime.

To protect response policing

We should make more use of fire stations, ambulance stations and other public buildings to provide more local operating bases for response officers. We owe a more rapid response to the people we serve.

Reduce the fear of crime and support victims of crime

It is imperative that we reduce the ‘fear of crime‘ throughout Nottinghamshire, even people living in the safest parts of the county can have their quality of life detrimentally affected by this. We need to improve the support for victims of crime.

Be more efficient with the money and resources

As a former senior police officer, he knows where savings can be made and re-invested in neighbourhood and response policing. Everything we do must be focused on front line policing.
He understands the importance of listening and passing on the views of all residents of Nottingham and Nottinghamshire. He would be proud to represent his home county as the Police and Crime Commissioner, making sure Nottinghamshire Police improves to become one of the best Police Forces in the country.

I am standing as UKIP’s Candidate because I believe that our police force should be held to account by someone who is not part of the establishment and who will scrutinise the strategic partnerships between police and local authorities.
During my career, I have specialised in project management of taking under-performing businesses, holding senior management to account and turning organisations around during financial difficulties. Nottinghamshire Police are in a poor financial position that has led to cuts to the front line and stations are closing.
I will aim to:

Have a zero tolerance to crime, reverse cuts to front line services.
Repair the bridge of trust between the people of Nottinghamshire communities and police.
Have more visible police, fully versed in common law to ensure people’s rights and property are protected.
Improve policing and deterrents to boost safety in our City and town centres, especially for the night time economy.
Provide a walk-in centre for members of the public and community groups to meet with the PCC team.
Introduce community policing, to ensure rural areas have a local face and local point of contact.
To prioritise the investigations into child sexual abuse and co-operate fully with the Goddard enquiry coming to Nottingham. This dark shadow has been cast over Nottingham for far too long, the survivors and victims need increased support and justice must be served.

If elected as PCC, I will uphold a 100% commitment to openness and transparency within the PCC office.

In the last four years, I’ve recruited more police officers and PCSOs despite funding cuts, given victims of crime a voice, properly funded victim services, and made tackling domestic violence a priority.
But there is unfinished business. I’m asking you for a mandate to continue working to keep your communities safe.
For almost fifty years, Nottinghamshire has been my home. I know its people and, importantly, their issues and concerns when it comes to crime and community safety.
Policing is going through huge change as it adapts to the challenges of 21st Century crime and funding. Yet, at its heart, it must remain a service which keeps you safe, reduces and prevents crime, and is held accountable.
As PCC, I will ensure you have a voice in shaping the way we police the streets of Nottinghamshire.
I will:


work with the Chief Constable to maintain neighbourhood police teams.
commission even better services for victims of crime. For too long domestic crimes have been hidden. I am committed to tackling domestic violence against women and girls, and I will target hate crime.
tackle the increased risk of cyber crime and online fraud, working with partners to safeguard young people both online and on our streets.
ensure Nottinghamshire residents are best protected from terrorism using intelligence analysis and an increased armed patrol presence.
keep my promise that victims of historic abuse in local children’s homes receive both support and the public inquiry they deserve.

Jason says his campaign will be about refocusing Nottinghamshire Police Force. He will root out police corruption, he will demand more front-line officers and ensure there are no more police station closures.
Jason, formerly a member of the County’s Police Authority and former Leader of Ashfield District Council, is clear that only he has the experience to bring about the urgent change needed to improve local policing.
At the last set of PCC Elections in 2012, an Independent Candidate came closest to beating Labour.  Jason said: “Since I announced my intention to stand for election, I have been contacted by members of all political parties with kind words and encouragement.  It is clear that this election will be a tight race between myself and Labour.”
Nottinghamshire Police have closed police stations, cut officer numbers and axed services right across our County and City. At the same time, they have increased spending on expensive spin doctors, increased pen-pushers and hiked up your council tax. The job of a PCC is to decide police priorities.  At the moment they seem determined to protect their dwindling authority at the expense of protecting the people of Nottinghamshire.
Jason would:

Scrap Labour’s waste on spin doctors.
Invest in frontline services.
Put more bobbies back on the beat in your area.
Not close any more Police Stations.
Ensure a fairer distribution of policing resources between the City and County.
Make your streets, parks and town centres feel safer.

Supporting Jason would mean real change here this time.

I am self-funding and completely independent of all political parties. I have more to give to my community and the post of Commissioner is the perfect way to do so. I have extensive knowledge of the police which will enable me to fulfil the duties of Commissioner with an unrivalled expertise.
When elected I will ensure the needs and aspirations of the communities of South Wales are the driving force behind the office. I will support the victims of crime and those who assist in this respect and to enable the police to properly address anti-social behaviour and drug crime.
It is vitally important that we maintain a strong and independent police force free from party politics. The public have a large part to play because the police are the public and the public are the police. Together with the Chief Constable we will be tough on crime and the causes of crime.

I have considerable experience in public service, having been a Councillor on Cardiff City Council from 1976 to 1995 when I didn’t seek re-election following my term as the Rt. Hon. Lord Mayor of Cardiff.

 

As a businessman for most of my life and serving on the Council’s Finance Committee, for some time as chairman, I can ensure that the principle of value for money will be brought to the role of PCC. When it’s the taxpayer’s money it is crucial that every penny is spent effectively and wisely.

 

I love living in South Wales, and my interests include spending time with my three sons and my grandchildren, and hosting family occasions. I also enjoy taking part in a variety of activities from sailing to skiing, motor sports to flying.

MY AIMS:

Ensure South Wales is a safer place to live and work.
Care about the community and be a strong voice for the public to ensure that public concerns are acted upon to meet local policing need in both urban and rural areas.
Champion local community policing with a strong visible presence on the streets by increasing the numbers of Special Constables.
Enhance the most important relationship- between the police and public.
Put the needs of victims at the heart of the system, including vulnerable people and encourage restorative justice.
Ensure South Wales Police provides a high quality, value for money, efficient, effective and accountable service for the public.
Advocate innovation, early intervention and best practice solutions to cut crime and reoffending.
Work with the police in partnership with local residents, other agencies (both statutory and faith/voluntary) to prevent crime and re-offending, to tackle anti-social behaviour, drugs and alcohol abuse, so that you feel and are safer on the streets and in your homes.

Budget cuts have forced a reduction from 3,400 to 2,800 in police officer numbers, but he’s worked closely with the Chief Constable and his team to build powerful alliances with the health service, with the seven local authorities of South Wales, and with voluntary & community groups to make the communities of South Wales safe.
This deeply-embedded partnership approach is now paying dividends for the people of South Wales, with initiatives helping to cut violence against women and girls, to intervene quickly with young offenders and women offenders to prevent re-offending, and a focus on protecting vulnerable people and supporting victims. He’s promoted the principles of co-operation and the concepts of “early innovation and prompt positive action” as the way to make communities safe.
In advance of this election, and building on these firm foundations, Alun has made six pledges to the people of South Wales :

To make your community safer by keeping policing local
To cut crime & disorder in co-operation with all public agencies
To protect the most vulnerable in our communities
To spend your money wisely to protect your local police team
To challenge the criminal justice system to meet the needs of victims
To play a part nationally and in tackling online threats

Alun’s Police and Crime Plan 2016-2021 spells out how, if re-elected, he’ll drive work forward to deliver on those promises. That plan can be seen on the official South Wales Police website at :

If elected my priorities would be to;

Restore confidence in the Police in the communities they serve, believing   that many problems could be identified and prevented from escalating by investing resources in local policing.
Scrutinise expenditure. Using my experience as an Opposition councillor I would challenge expenditure to ensure that monies are being used wisely and to best effect.
Cut costs.  As Commissioner I would commit to taking less than the current published salary level in order to invest in putting more Police Officers on the beat.
Improve communication. I believe that a Commissioner must be accessible to the communities of South Wales and I have personally visited many parts of the South Wales Police area, from the Rhondda to Butetown; the Gower to Bridgend; Swansea to Port Talbot, in the months leading up to the election.
Listen and learn. As a Councillor I have learned a great deal from working closely with my local Police officers. They tell me that the problems being experienced in my community are replicated throughout the South Wales area. I commit to continuing to listen to   communities and serving   Police officers and to use that knowledge to inform the decisions that I take.

If elected I will use my experience gained as a teacher, a councillor and a Mum to serve the people of South Wales to the best of my ability.

It’s something I’m familiar with – my postcode has the highest theft and burglary rate in Wales, and last year my own home was broken into. I am more than qualified to be your Police and Crime Commissioner, having spent 8 years in charge of Cardiff’s community safety. We made so many improvements that people now take for granted:

Making pubs serve only in plastic cups on event days to reduce glassing;
Working to reduce waiting times for substance misuse treatment from 9 months to 9 weeks;
More police on the beat by working with South Wales Police to fund more PCSOs.

I’ll bring to this role a can-do attitude, along with enthusiasm and fresh ideas. I don’t want to sit on the sidelines when I have ideas to improve our police services. One of the first things I will do as your Commissioner is work with colleagues from other police forces to share back-office staff and reduce costs. Instead of wasting thousands of police hours chasing after people whose only crime is possessing cannabis, I will target resources to rehabilitation and treatment for those with a drug addiction. I don’t think it’s fair that in many parts of Wales a black person is more likely to be stopped and searched than a white person, and I will work to ensure this isn’t happening in our communities. I’ll be the liberal, community-focused voice that South Wales Police desperately needs, and will work tirelessly to build a police force that works for you. Please support me to put these ideas into practice.

I would use that power to hold the chief constable to account and act to ensure that the police and victims of crime get the best force for their money. It is my intention to try and restore the respect the police deserve for upholding the law of England and maintaining the Queen’s peace.
However that means they must have the trust of the citizens whose consent they police by under English common law. It is imperative that justice is not only done, but seen to be done for the victims of crime, the perpetrators and those who have failed in the lawful and moral duty to those whom they serve.
The strategy for South Yorkshire police force should be trying to prevent crime where possible. Solving crime is difficult and costly.
Visible policing should be carried out by warranted offices and any savings should be from other areas
The policing budget needs to be examined to identify if taxpayers money is being spent as they would wish rather than how the police like allocating it.
Politically correctness should be removed from police work. It interferes with the Law be applied equally and without fear or favour.

I came into office in the wake of the child sexual exploitation (CSE) scandal in Rotherham.
Public trust was shaken. The police were in shock at what was revealed. I said that confidence could only be rebuilt if the police acknowledged past mistakes, improved their practice and brought prosecutions.
It took determination. As a result, this is now happening. The first major trials at Sheffield Crown Court in February led to five people being gaoled with sentences totalling over 100 years. More trials are coming.
I also said that I would:

put victims of crime at the heart of local policing
consult with CSE victims, survivors and their families and enable them to assist the police with their training and practice
maintain neighbourhood policing, despite big cuts in police numbers and police grant by government
pursue efficiency and effectiveness in policing and support services
give half my salary to local groups, especially those supporting victims and tackling crime and anti-social behaviour.

I kept those promises.
My priorities for the next 4 years are:

working hard to make South Yorkshire a safe place to live, learn and work by tackling crime and anti-social behaviour, protecting the vulnerable, and requiring the police to treat all people and communities with fairness
maintaining Police Community Support Officer numbers at the current level because they are often the ears and eyes of the police locally
replacing the old 101 technology with a new system which you can trust
managing the £240m budget to ensure efficiency and effectiveness

Married with four children, I am familiar with local schools and hospitals! I have always given back to the community, so my Plan for South Yorkshire police is to:

Rebuild Trust – There is much work to do to rebuild communities’ trust so that we can benefit again from policing by consent across the whole county. There have been so many allegations of collusion between local councils and the police that a fresh approach, led by someone untainted by the past, is imperative.
Put Victims First – Victims, and those in fear of crime, need to know that I will put their needs and rights ahead of criminals. This involves working with, and expanding, the excellent front line police that we have, to focus on communities’ real needs.
Ensure Real Cultural Change – The police need to know that they have a Police and Crime Commissioner who will support their every effort to refocus the organisation’s culture away from red tape and back covering and towards serving our neighbourhoods better.
Ensure More Resources reach the front line – In addition to cutting red tape, I want to drive cost reductions in back office and administrative areas, explore ways that costs could be shared with neighbouring areas or other emergency services. If elected, I will lobby the Home Secretary for additional resources for South Yorkshire.
Bring a Fresh Approach to the Police – I will do this by not shirking from asking the difficult questions about issues that for too long have been swept under the carpet so that today’s police force can start to look forward and embed the lessons and cultural change required.

I was a serving Police Officer for 17 years and I know how the Police Service works and what the issues faced on a daily basis by Police Officers and PCSOs are. They put their lives at risk to protect us and deserve a Police and Crime Commissioner who understands and supports them rather than others who see the Police as a business to be cut.
As Leader of Cannock Chase Council for the last 5 years I have improved services while keeping council tax increases to a minimum, running the council efficiently and well.
As PCC I will keep policing local and keep PCs and PCSOs local too. Current plans are for most investigations to be run from two County ‘hubs’. This would remove officers from communities, destroying neighbourhood policing.
In Staffordshire since the last PCC election, the number of Police Officers working on the response units has been reduced to dangerously low levels. Hundreds of officers have been lost from Staffordshire Police. Police morale is at an all-time low and the Force has been found to be inadequate in its treatment of vulnerable domestic violence victims.
 
Since 2012 Officers have been cut but there has been heavy spending on the PCC office, with the PR machine being put ahead of Police Officers. As PCC I would be looking to run an efficient office to reduce costs, putting money back into local policing.
 
I can also confirm I have no wish to take over the Fire service regardless of what the Tory Government would like.
 
Protecting local policing so the Police can protect us. If elected on May 5th, that is what I will do.

Natalie Devaney,https://1rbena1k2rviaenzl3kexmgl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Natalie-Devaney.jpg,Independent,,"I am Natalie Devaney standing as an Independent Candidate, my message in this campaign is that I strongly believe that we should
Keep Party Politics Out of Policing
As an Independent Candidate I have no affiliation to any political party and I am self-funded.
Upon being elected the Police and Crime Commissioner swears an Oath of Impartiality before taking Office. As an Independent Candidate I am genuinely impartial.
I describe myself as hardworking, dedicated, honest and open with a “down to earth” approach. I will be easily accessible to the People of Staffordshire; you will know me.
Having served as a frontline police officer for thirty years, I retired in July, 2015. During this time, I worked in most areas of our County, Staffordshire. When I first joined I was living in Werrington and had gone to Leek College and to Staffs Poly to study law. I was first posted, in 1985 to Burton and finished my service at Newcastle.
My first-hand experience of policing means that I know what the reality is, NOW and what course of action to take, from Day 1.
I want to ensure fair outcomes for all and respond to the needs of the public. In short, to be the Voice of the people and ensure Staffordshire Police is operating effectively to meet these needs.
I care passionately about Our future. At the end of the day, I firmly believe that an individual needs to know properly about policing and how to affect change for the right reasons, not political ones.
Finally, the role of the Police and Crime Commissioner it is a question of Integrity and Accountability is key, to do the right thing is paramount.

As Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner I have been responsible for spending £180million of public money each year and ensuring the work of police is effective at keeping 1.2million people living here safe.
When elected in November 2012 there was a £19.8million hole in police finances but a firm grip on spending means budgets are in decent shape to 2020. I’ve not raised, at all, the part of council tax local people pay towards policing.
I am committed to community policing. There are 1% more response and neighbourhood officers in Stoke-on-Trent & Staffordshire than when I was elected whereas in Labour PCC areas the average is 17% fewer.
The mobile technology revolution I promised in 2013 to get officers out of stations and on the streets is on track to deliver 250,000 extra hours of frontline policing annually… equivalent to 110 extra officers… but at one eighth of the cost!
Critical to the future is preparing our police to meet changing crime in an internet enabled world. Online fraud, organised crime and the abhorrent abuse of children are threats beyond what could have been imagined.
The strategic technology partnership I’ve signed with Boeing will improve the way Staffordshire Police deal with day to day crimes and crucially prepare them to tackle the harm caused by criminal use of technology.
See my website for more about criminal asset seizures now going back to communities, 5700 insurance dodgers taken off Staffordshire roads, better support through the Staffordshire Victim Gateway and how the Police Cadets I promised are enhancing young lives.

I believe that the role of the Police and Crime Commissioner is to be able to lead a team, control and set priorities by maximising the budget, enabling the police to have a more visible presence on the street and better relate to working with the local communities that they serve. I believe that by making their presence visible they will develop links with the electorate, which I feel has been missing for many years. If elected, I would like to go out and engage with the constabulary in different areas, because rural and urban policing have very different priorities. This will enable me to understand and crucially, appreciate through dialogue what is required in the varied and diverse areas of Staffordshire.
 
I am standing because I wish to help set priorities for police resources and would like to bring some common sense to this role by consulting the public in the community on the issues that are close to their hearts. I would also seek to consider disposal of assets that are no longer required/underutilised in order to assist with funding the very necessary role of front line policing.
 
Tackling youth anti-social behaviour (which seems to be a rising trend in recent years) would be a foremost issue for myself, assisting in guiding them towards joining different youth activity groups. I would also like to help the parents of school children starting secondary school by having talks within various schools in the Staffordshire area, providing information on the support and resources available if they have a concern about their child’s well-being.

Whilst Paul is endorsed by the Green Party, he will answer only to the people of Staffordshire. He will appoint an independent deputy commissioner based on merit. He has a vision for better policing which is community built and YOU will be able to hold Paul and the police service to account. Community priorities highlighted to date include:

Resist further budget cuts: Staffordshire already has one the lowest number of employees per head of population. These cuts have had serious consequences.
Tackle domestic abuse and violent crime: Staffordshire’s record on domestic abuse and violent crime requires improvement. He will invest in quality training of officers dealing with abuse and champion other agencies to ensure victims are supported.
Abandon plans to bring the Fire Service under control of the PCC: The services should remain separate whilst maintaining their close working relationship.
Restorative Justice: Criminals owe a debt to society but a greater debt to their victims. When victims want it, we will facilitate communication and ensure offenders make amends directly to the victim. Restorative Justice has been shown to reduce re-offending rates.
Online crime strategy: He will ensure officers have up-to-date skills, training and support to tackle this emerging and fast growing threat
Drug addiction: Refocus drug policy by getting addicts into recovery and tackling the organised criminals who profit from misery. Tackling drug issues can reduce crime substantially.
Rural crime: Bringing the protection of our countryside and wildlife front and centre
Early intervention strategies: Working with related agencies to develop effective engagement programmes for young people to prevent them getting involved in crime in the first place

Improving relationships between police, local support groups and charities; both tackling causes of crime within the community whilst ensuring that all officers have the best possible training and understanding of social issues

–  Continued assistance to victims to be offered, taking ownership for individuals continued welfare.
–  To provide more support for constructive, restorative justice.

Tackling hate crime in all forms

He is committed to seeing that Suffolk is a safer place to travel around, work, live and raise a family. Tim fought to retain the police control room in Suffolk and said, “More than 800 of our 1,100 officers are employed in county policing and the preservation of our own unique culture and identity is vital for public trust and confidence.
 
Under Tim’s leadership, and working with Government, there has been a
 

Overall 25% cut in crime nationally since 2012
Major investment in roads policing to protect the safety of all road users whether they are motorists, cyclists, pedestrians or horse riders, with campaigns to target reckless speeders and drivers using their hand-held mobile phones.
Focus on rural crime with two new dedicated rural crime teams

 
He pledges to build on these successes with
 

A greater focus on the hidden crimes which wreck people’s lives such as domestic violence, grooming, people trafficking and cyber crime.
To increase the number of operational police officers in the county as well as investing in training and kit for the constabulary
A drive to improve detection rates further to protect victims and deter would-be criminals

A vote for Cath Pickles in the Police and Crime Commissioner elections is a vote for:

Protection and prioritisation of front line policing: Cath opposes the drastic reduction of the number of Police Community Support Officers included in the Local Policing Plan
Challenge to the consensus: Suffolk needs a Police & Crime Commissioner who does not take their lead from conservatives on Suffolk’s district and county councils
Prioritising prevention of sexual and violent crime
A joined-up education strategy to protect EVERY child in the county from sexual abuse and exploitation
A joined-up strategy with health, mental health and social services to protect vulnerable and “at-risk” residents from crime and the fear of crime
An experienced senior leader, mediator and skilled communicator, capable of finding consensus and solutions

This election will have an important impact on the future of policing in Suffolk. Please use your vote to elect Cath Pickles as our Police & Crime Commissioner.

In public life I have been Mayor of Southwold, Vice Chairman of Waveney District Council/Portfolio holder for customer service, Probation officer, lifeboat crewman, Retained Fireman, Chairman of a regional community emergency group plus a number of other posts.
I am passionate about public service being correctly funded and given the resources to perform, coupled with running a budget that makes that service very efficient.
The Police and Crime Commissioner must give a 100% commitment to the role, ensure that there is necessary accountability at all levels of policing, its operational focus and delivery, its record on financial performance.
The office of the PCC will have a complete open door policy both from the public and police. At all times information will be available and any communication acted upon appropriately and on time.
Suffolk Constabulary is considered is be one of the best Police Force in the UK but it must be correctly funded and have a connection on the ground with the public.
The key areas is engagement with the public on the ground, this includes schools, inner towns and ethnic minority groups. Cybercrime is on the increase and this must be counteracted. A ‘Zero Tolerance Policy’ implemented in anti-social behaviour hotspots.
As a committed, full time UKIP Police & Crime Commissioner I will always listen and respond to your concerns.

I have worked proudly as a civilian alongside Police Officers of all ranks and dealt with the victims of crime and the perpetrators of crime.
My work on behalf of the community has led to a Chief Constable’s Commendation and a High Sheriff of Surrey Award.
My legal background has been enhanced by experience in accountancy and I believe in fiscal responsibility at every level of law and order provision. There is no room for waste especially when budgets are tight and I guarantee a policy of ‘good housekeeping’ at all times in all departments.
In listening to Surrey residents it is clear to me that my key objectives as PCC must be:
More visible Policing, you should recognise your local Police and I will insist that more officers including senior ranks walk the beat and get more involved with our community.
Engage with the youth of Surrey, we have a remarkable resource in our younger people and we need more engagement, I will establish a Youth Board to develop, debate and listen.
Tackle the blight of drug and drink abuse, my work with Drug and Alcohol Abuse Awareness in Schools has shown me exactly where the problems are and how we can fix them.
Make improved road safety a priority by addressing the issues of anti-social driving behaviour, increasing safe road use awareness and getting tough on offenders.
Increase the number of Police Officers, by reducing the costs associated with the PCC role I will directly recruit additional Police Officers.

I’ve balanced the demands of Terrorism against Neighbourhood Policing; in the UK or when working in Iraq. Whether in uniform or as a detective, I know the Police business.
I’ve seen too many victims, their tears and blood; that’s why I loathe criminals. That’s why I became your PCC. I understand police budgets; what works. I do practical delivery. I’ve combined this extensive Police knowledge with my Army Officer training to bring focus and my commercial experience to protect you in Surrey.
I’ve concentrated on getting more enforcement against the bad; a Zero Tolerance Approach, whilst also rehabilitating those offenders who can be redeemed and at the same time improving things for victims.
We now:
*Fund more police than before I started.
*Reducing burglary 24%, car crime 34%.
*Solve more sexual assaults and violence than before.
*Protect vulnerable children and women better.
*Establish uniformed council enforcement teams against anti-social behaviour ; fly tipping, litter; more are planned.
*Protect children and elderly against cyber criminals.
*Spend £2m+ on victims; women and minorities. Imagine children taken by mum to a refuge; next day going to their new school in the wrong uniform. It’s humiliating? Now we fund their new uniforms immediately.
*We rehabilitate youngsters; funding carpentry, mechanic and confidence training, taking some into prisons to meet inmates. We’re keeping them out of the Court System.
*Government know I fight for Surrey; they hear about it continually on the media.
*I don’t do what “the party” says. I battle for Surrey People. That’s why we can now fund more cops than before I started.

I have served in the Army for 12 years as a senior detective in the Special Investigation Branch of the Military Police, including a 2-year tour in Northern Ireland. My goals revolve around my belief: Prevention is better than cure. I will look to tried and tested policing to break the cycle of crime. I will: –

listen to the people and find effective ways to communicate and represent them
make prevention and reduction of crime a key objective
offer all victims of crime appropriate support, including where wanted Restorative Justice
prioritise child and domestic abuse, historic and recent
specifically aim to reduce the number of offenders and victims aged 18 to 24 years; this group commit the most offences
maximise prevention opportunities and communicate these to the public to reduce all crime, including terrorism, as well as the increasing cyber threats
support officers, staff and volunteers – they are our greatest asset
encourage and expect leaders to inspire the workforce to develop our service

I am originally from Leeds but I have lived in Farnham (Surrey) for the past 12 years, I am 53 and currently I am employed as a Train Driver based at Kings Cross, London.
Coming from a different background to the professional police and political candidates, I will bring real life experience, knowledge and perspective to the role of the Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner.
My immediate priorities if I get elected are:
To ensure accountability, leadership and stability within the Surrey police chain of command, I therefore commit that my first action on being elected would be to appoint a permanent Surrey Chief Constable with the necessary skill sets.
I will work to formulate proposals to protect Surrey residents from the emerging threat of internet crime. I will ensure that the review into policing, recommended by The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), into the failings by Surrey Police of an online child grooming case are implemented.
To get the best policing for the residents of Surrey requires adequate funding; I will fight any reduction in budgets that affect the policing of Surrey. I will halt the continual downgrading of our police service within Surrey; the closures of police stations and centralisation of policing resources do not benefit the vast majority of Surrey residents. The presence of uniformed officers within our local communities needs reinvigorating. I will ensure that privatisation of the policing services within Surrey is not on the agenda.

Like many people I disagree with the idea of PCCs, but we’re stuck with them for now. That’s why I’m offering a positive, balanced, community-based alternative – not more prisons, privatisation or meaningless ‘zero tolerance’ promises.
I’ll focus on what actually works to prevent crime:

bringing back community policing
safeguarding victims and vulnerable children and adults
working with our neighbours
modern police training and equipment
designing out crime with safer roads and more activities for young people
tackling offending behaviour through restorative justice, education and treatment for mental health and drug problems
more tough community sentences with longer prison terms for dangerous and persistent offenders.

I’ll work with and challenge the police and other agencies to ensure they address and anticipate threats to our safety, fight crime and defend victims. I’ll be fiercely independent of government, demand proper funding and efficiencies to keep policing in public hands, and give fair, frank and balanced reports back to the people of Surrey.
I’m a former barrister, accountant and actuary with thirty years’ professional leadership experience in both private and public sectors. I have a strong background in criminal law and financial management and scrutiny. For ten years I have provided strategic direction and independent oversight to other public interest organisations on a non-political basis.

I have learnt how to get the best out of a team and how to get the most out of a tight budget, qualities essential for a Police Commissioner.
Surrey County Councillor for over 20 years, including 4 years as Executive Member for Adult Services and 2 years as Council Chairman.
Despite excellent work by individual front-line police officers, The Inspectorate found that Surrey Police overall “requires improvement” in being efficient and effective in keeping us safe. I am determined to make it the best police force in the country. My plan for achieving this is:
Cutting Crime and Keeping Surrey Safe
I will ensure that Surrey Police delivers more visible policing, relentlessly pursues criminals, improves detection rates and reduces re-offending.
Tackling Rural Crime
I will overhaul the 101 hotline, improve response times and ensure victims have a single point of contact throughout an investigation.
Making our Town Centres Safe
Our town centres can become noisy and violent places after dark. I will work with officers, local businesses and residents to make our town centres safe for everyone.
Supporting Victims
Independent inspectors rated Surrey Police’s support for victims as ‘inadequate’. I will take urgent action to provide proper support for the victims of crime.
Making Every Pound Count
I will fight for fair funding for Surrey Police and target resources at the front line to drive down response times and improve detection rates.
Tackling the Threat of Terrorism
We face new threats from terrorists, home-grown and from abroad. I will review the plan to deter and defeat terrorists in Surrey and give this top priority.

Police on the front line in Surrey are doing an excellent job, but there are not enough police working in the community and poor leadership means that many victims of crime are being let down, with too many crimes not being investigated or recorded and not enough crimes being solved. 
I believe that every victim of crime has the right to expect the police service to do everything reasonably possible to investigate it and bring the perpetrator to justice. We need a real focus on anti-social behaviour; if ‘petty criminals’ are not dealt with effectively they grow into tomorrow’s serious criminals. 
We can achieve this by allocating more resources to front line policing, improving 101 service response times and ensuring that those at the top of the police service target the issues that matter most to the communities they serve.
On election my immediate priority would be to consult widely in Surrey on a plan to put policing at the heart of the community, working together with victims, prisons, partnership organisations, the government and the judiciary.
I believe that my extensive background in leadership and accountability means I have the necessary skills and experience to bring the best out of Surrey Police, so we can all feel safer and enjoy better policing in Surrey.
Thank you for reading. I will be honoured to serve you.

Having served as Sussex Police & Crime Commissioner (PCC) since 2012, I have the experience and proven track record to continue making a difference to policing.
As PCC, I have held the police to account on behalf of residents, supported victims of crime and made considerable savings to reinvest in frontline policing.
SOME ACHIEVEMENTS SO FAR

Opened recruitment for 100 new Police Constables, more PCSOs and issued cameras to all frontline officers
£20million upgrade programme for police stations
Established an award-winning Youth Commission, nationally recognised for outstanding public engagement
Encouraged the creation of dedicated business/cybercrime strategy for Sussex
Funding support for victims of abuse, serious sexual offences, child exploitation
Established the UK’s first Elders Commission – giving older people a voice on policing

MY PLAN TO CONTINUE DELIVERING
If re-elected I will continue to:

Deliver effective neighbourhood policing to our rural communities, towns and city
Support victims of crime, especially our elderly and young
Cut crime, catch criminals and reduce reoffending
Protect our most vulnerable against all forms of abuse
Improve access to justice for local people and put victims at the heart of the criminal justice system
Invest in frontline policing and further improve the performance and efficiency of Sussex Police

This election really matters – the PCC is responsible for setting the £250m budget for policing in Sussex, has the power to appoint and dismiss the Chief Constable and must ensure residents’ views are heard when setting policing priorities.
I’ve travelled the length and breadth of Sussex hearing peoples’ views about what matters in local policing. We’ve made real progress to deliver on these priorities – let’s not put that work at risk now.
Strong Leadership. A Clear Plan.  A More Secure Future

I live in Worthing, and my wife recently retired after thirty years’ service as a Sussex Police officer.  I have also been a member of the Sussex Probation Board.
Like other public services, the police have suffered six years of cuts and creeping privatisation. When services are sold off to private companies, profit is prioritised over people.  I will fight to protect police resources and use them efficiently to keep us safe in our homes and on our streets.
I support more emphasis on crime prevention and reducing re-offending. For example, restorative justice helps offenders face the consequences of their actions and gives victims a better sense of justice.
Above all, we should have a police service, not a police force: working for local communities. Homelessness and drug use are major problems in Sussex, and I will address them with an honest, evidence-based approach. The ‘war on drugs’ has comprehensively failed, and drugs need to be seen as a health issue, not a criminal one.  Criminalising our most vulnerable people is not only inhumane, it simply doesn’t work.
The police also must do more to tackle hate crime in Sussex – racism, domestic abuse and LGBT abuse are not prioritised.
A Green vote on the 5th May is a vote for open, transparent policing that does not ignore those in need. I’ll work tirelessly to protect the rights, freedoms and safety of everyone in the community.

Michael is the leading councillor for Public Protection at Crawley Borough Council, with responsibility for community safety and fighting crime and anti-social behaviour.
Michael’s priorities for Sussex Police

Reverse the proposed cuts to front-line policing and keep a presence in every town, every village
Strengthen the fight against internet and telephone scammers
Make residents’ local priorities the Police’s priorities, like anti-social behaviour
Give low level crime the attention it deserves
Stronger action on hate crime

Sussex Police is set to lose huge numbers of neighbourhood police and PCSOs. 
Michael will attempt to stop the current round of savage Tory cuts to community policing on the first day after being elected, doing whatever is necessary to save existing officers and restore Police morale.
Local people know the worth of community policing, and the benefits to crime reduction through greater visibility and information gathering. We need a new PCC to save Community Policing and to stop Sussex Police making a historic mistake.
Make sure your vote counts.
If you don’t want to see the Conservatives win this time, remember Labour was in second place at the last Sussex PCC election. You get a second preference vote in this election.

Here are my top priorities for making our streets safer:

Safeguard frontline police and community support officers
Cut re-offending
More focus on preventing crime
More use of restorative justice and community service.

Police officers have a tough job and they need more support. But Sussex Police has put up with a whopping £65m in cuts over the last 5 years. Worse still, Sussex Police faces millions more in cuts in the years ahead. That’s the same as about 700 frontline police officers! We need to stop the cuts. That’s why I will fight to get more government money to tackle crime.
The police are too often tied up in red tape. We need to free up the police to spend less time behind computers and more time on the streets.
I’ll also make sure we do more to stop re-offending. Focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice, so people pay back victims and the local community would cut crime, save police time and taxpayers’ money.
More should be done to stop people becoming criminals in the first place. We need to identify and support at-risk teenagers and young adults before they fall into a life of crime, often to support drug addiction.
I am a retired Sussex GP with more than 40 years of experience as a local councillor. I’m also a former Chairman of Sussex Police Authority.
I’ll use that experience to ensure that we are tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. 
With your support I’ll make sure we have an effective, well-funded police force that will help keep you and your family safe.

As Police & Crime Commissioner I would:
Emphasise improved detection rates – for years Thames Valley did not solve enough crimes;
Ensure support for victims of crime is funded and not cut;
Protect frontline policing including bobbies on the beat;
Work with other agencies to ensure cases are progressed to court as quickly as possible;
Consult the public, community groups and elected representatives including town and parish councils about local policing priorities;
Listen to young people who cannot vote, but need a say about both crime and policing issues;
Ensure value for money – but protect services to the public.
 
Thames Valley is a very large police area, the largest non-urban police force in England. It ranges from sparsely populated rural areas in the Chilterns, Cotswolds and Berkshire Downs to urban centres such as Slough, Reading, Newbury, Oxford, Banbury, Bicester, Aylesbury, High Wycombe, Milton Keynes and many other towns and villages.
 
My key tasks as Police & Crime Commissioner:

Reduce crime and the fear of crime;
Improve police accountability, visibility, and work to raise public confidence in the police;
Target resources on detecting crime and cutting offending rates

 
My background

22 years a Magistrate in Oxfordshire
Financial experience in the public, voluntary and private sectors, including running my own company.
National experience of criminal justice system. Led demands to stop police using out of court disposals that prevented cases coming to court and, as a result, victims not receiving compensation.
Expert on licensing law, and effects of the night time economy.
Been a victim of crime, including a stabbing and several burglaries.

CONSERVATIVE POLICE & CRIME COMMISSIONER 
CANDIDATE FOR THE THAMES VALLEY
Anthony was elected as Police and Crime Commissioner in November 2012. Since his election he has been working hard to reduce crime across the Thames Valley and is proud of the successes Thames Valley Police has achieved.
“I am delighted to have been selected as the Conservative candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner for the Thames Valley Police area.
I have had two careers, the first in the Army, joining at 17. I spent much of my time commanding helicopter squadrons as well as being in the infantry worldwide. I have also had a career in industry, much of it as Managing Director of a well known aircraft manufacturer. I have an MSc, and have studied terrorism at University.
Since 2012 I’ve worked hard to achieve the pledges made at the last election. During this time Thames Valley Police have managed the reduction in funding whilst at the same time improving performance.
I hope you are able to vote for me to continue to drive down crime across the Thames Valley.”
Your priorities are my priorities
1 – To reduce crime and drive up detection rates.
2 – To maintain the balance between urban and rural policing.
3 – To ensure that the Police budget is targeted effectively.
4 – To protect vulnerable people.
5 – To ensure the Police act firmly and fairly, using good judgement to deal with the public politely, gaining their respect and acting with integrity.

The PCC role is about leadership and community engagement. Our Thames Valley Police give an outstanding service to the community, however, I am acutely aware of the pressures being put on the police force by austerity cuts. It is vital that any PCC holds not only the Chief Constable to account but the Government as well and this is something I will do to get the best for the people of Thames Valley. Combining a well-structured education program and increased frontline officers will be essential to delivering a promise to reduce the fear of crime and crime itself. Tackling business crime and increasing the efforts on rural crime reduction will be a key priority of mine too. My dedication and honesty will have a positive impact on our community, for a safer community.
If elected as your Police & Crime Commissioner, I will stand up as the straight-talking voice of the people in Thames Valley and I will make sure we reduce the fear of crime by bringing back the old ‘bobby on the beat’ to ensure continuity, increased visibility & faith in the Police force. I am passionate about restoring trust between the community and the police force and I will build a team that listens, supports and serve the community.
The keys to a successful Local Police and Crime plan are accountability, accessibility and transparency. I have served our country; I now wish to serve our community.

“My priorities are clear. I want to put victims first. Warwickshire needs a Police and Crime Commissioner who stands up for our residents. We need to invest in high visibility policing and safer neighbourhood teams. They are the bedrock of community policing. They gather intelligence and assure local communities that their concerns will be heard.
In developing a new Police and Crime Plan for Warwickshire I will begin by listening hard to the aspirations and priorities of our diverse communities. That means being out in the community, meeting people and listening to them. This will make sure our new plan reflects the needs of  Warwickshire, not the penny pinching of the government.
Warwickshire is one of the country’s smaller police authorities and has an unusual geography. I will work to ensure that our police service will work with their police service neighbours whilst maintaining our unique local identity. I will encourage the use of new technology but always ensure that our police do not lose the personal touch. As our community changes, so does the nature of crime. Resources put into prevention, especially in such areas as domestic abuse and cyber crime will prove cost effective in the future.
Serious cuts are being made to Warwickshire’s police budget. This cannot be defended, and I will speak out loudly about the inequity of our funding. I will examine our budget carefully to ensure that Warwickshire receives the high quality, efficient and effective policing it deserves.”

I was honoured to be selected to stand as the Conservative candidate in October 2015, and have been visiting towns and villages across the county since. I am very keen to act as a “Champion” for all residents and represent their views on Policing and Crime.
I will hold the Chief Constable to account, prepare and agree a Policing Plan, and allocate the necessary resources to ensure the Plan is carried out.
I am keen to see the numbers of Officers, PCSO’s and Specials increase, so that residents can be assured that their safety is my prime concern and purpose. To achieve this, I have a six point plan:

Ensure our Police are properly equipped, trained and motivated


Increase the numbers of Police Officers, PCSO’s and Specials across Warwickshire


Free the Police to fight crime, by cutting red tape and prioritising the front line


Support the victims of crime by working closely with local agencies


Increase Police visibility throughout the County


Bring criminals to justice to protect our local communities

 
As PCC I will always put people before politics, and with my experience as a Warwickshire businessman, an ex- Commanding Officer of my Regiment and 14 years of being a local councillor, I understand how both local communities and large organisations expect unbiased advice and direction from the PCC.
I look forward to directing the Police to tackle all forms of crime in Warwickshire, whether it be violent, fraudulent, speeding, anti-social behaviour or any other crime being suffered, as well as putting the victim first.
I look forward to receiving your vote on May 5th, so I can begin this important job.

Do we need more police officers? Or do we need fewer criminals?
We need to tackle crime at its source by preventing criminal attitudes and behaviours from developing. I will put greater focus on prevention to complement the work our police service already does in responding to crimes, securing a safer county for us all.
I’m standing as an independent candidate because party-politics has no place in policing. Born and raised in Warwickshire, I have direct experience working with two PCCs. Our county needs a fresh approach to tackling crime, which starts with these eight promises I make to you:
I will focus on preventing crimes, not simply reacting to them.
I will seek to break the age-crime curve, where 18-24 year olds commit the most crime and are the most common victims of crime.
I will keep party-politics out of policing.
I will work hard to bring hidden abuse into the open where it can be challenged and stopped.
I will give the people of Warwickshire a voice in the policing and criminal justice matters of their county.
I will refocus drug policy by getting addicts into recovery and tackling the organised criminals who profit from misery.
I will ensure cyber-crime is a priority and that Warwickshire can face this modern and growing threat.
I will pursue policies based on evidence that have been proven to work.
 
“Ben is dynamic, with a clear grasp of the issues facing modern policing. We need fresh thinking to take on the challenges facing policing today. I know that I would have greatly welcomed and would have derived great benefit from his support, insights and knowledge when I was a Chief Constable.”

As a former senior officer in Warwickshire Police, I believe I have the essential skills, qualities and experience needed to be your PCC. Working at the highest levels across all five boroughs and districts I gained in-depth knowledge and experience of policing the county.
 
I have always been passionate and committed to delivering a professional, modern, innovative police force and I have a proven record of working with all communities and organisations in crime reduction and safety.
 
The job of Police and Crime Commissioner is to hold the force to account on its delivery, professionalism and results, and to scrutinise performance and challenge when necessary.
 
With this in mind, my key aims are:
 

Improve the visibility of officers on our streets

 

Oversee an increase in police numbers as a main priority

 

Question the reasons for the high level of days lost through sickness

 

Ensure a swift response to emergency calls

 

Tackle rural crime, business crime and cyber-crime by supporting multi-agency initiatives

 

Ensure criminals and high crime areas are targeted by the use of technology and proactive police teams

 

Focus on initiatives supporting vulnerable victims in society

 

Work closely with communities in support of best practice crime reduction initiatives

 

Ensure young people are supported by awareness and crime diversion schemes

 

Encourage more recruits from ethnic minorities

 

Manage the budget to ensure that efficiencies are achieved from our partnership with West Mercia Police, thereby making more funds available for extra police officers

 

Develop an open and accessible engagement strategy, listen to the views of the people and hold the Chief Constable to account for the performance of the force

 

Ensure Warwickshire is a professional police force with a strong identity in the partnership with West Mercia

My background is in business, Local Government, Prison Service and with the former police authority.
I have a track record of standing up for my local community and delivering on my promises.
I have set out my vision for a safer West Mercia at www.campion4westmercia.com but the key highlights are:

A Secure West Mercia; keeping us safe against threats locally and nationally. Ensuring the Police are there in times of emergency including having enough armed police. I will work hard so that criminals are brought to justice quickly and that we are on the side of victims.
A Reformed West Mercia; I will champion innovation to make sure your money is spent efficiently before I ever ask you to pay any more. I will modernise the back office to divert more money to protect front line policing.  I will be transparent in how decisions are made to restore the trust of our community.
A Reassured West Mercia; I will work hard to ensure people feel safe as for too long antisocial behaviour has blighted our towns and rural communities feel forgotten. I will also invest in crime prevention to tackle the root causes of crime.

West Mercia Police is made up of hard working officers and staff but they need a strong Commissioner to stand shoulder to shoulder with them. I will work tirelessly to be that Strong Commissioner, representing the diverse views of our many communities and ensuring that they are represented at the heart of policing.
With your support on Thursday 5th May, we can start to build a Safer West Mercia.
Yours sincerely,

I have many years experience in business, both on my own account, and as a consultant, turning around major companies, world-wide, into efficient ‘fit for purpose’ operations and I believe my wide experience in leadership roles in business, the judiciary, and sport, would be put to good use in the service of West Mercia.
After spending some time with management, I am satisfied that, fiscally, West Mercia is well run. Operationally, there has been demoralising comment in the local press regarding the Peel report, but I am satisfied that the areas of concern highlighted are already being addressed.
I am concerned that despite large sums spent on national security, we cannot hope to guarantee safety from external threats unless we have control of our country’s borders. Locally, I have concerns that rural areas are under-policed, whilst child and domestic crime, as well as theft and burglary, are increasing, with detection rates for the latter falling. Cyber crime, and online security too, are becoming increasingly important issues as society changes.
Finally, there appears to be an assumption that the Commissioner is unable to challenge the government on funding but I would have no such inhibitions, political or otherwise, where a case could be made for additional funding.
I confirm this form has been prepared by me.

He is a professor at Birmingham University specialising in policing and criminal justice. Throughout his career he has worked with senior police and criminal justice officials, leading research projects for the Home Office, Ministry of Justice, Victim Support and other national agencies, as well as for local police, courts and probation organisations. He knows the issues and challenges for PCCs well.
For 20 years he has also served as a local councillor – at parish, district and county levels – and so is used to addressing individual and community problems and holding public servants to account for the work they are paid to do on our behalf.
His candidacy for the Office of PCC reflects his deep commitment to local democratic control of public services and he favours devolving as much responsibility as possible to local commanders of policing areas.
John’s key goal in relation to policing and crime is to make people safer, and feel safer. To that end, he wants to increase speed enforcement on our roads, and the visibility of police on our streets, so strengthening their interaction with local communities. He also wishes to see more people having the confidence to report the crimes they suffer, particularly domestic violence, sexual abuse and other under-reported violations.
John supports more investment in activities for young people, so addressing issues that often lead to anti-social behaviour and crime. He also wants to see more restorative justice schemes, with offenders making reparations to victims and engaging in activities that address problems underlying their misbehaviour (e.g. alcohol and drug treatment programmes, and one-to-one mentoring schemes that support offenders in finding suitable jobs, accommodation and in living healthier, less chaotic lives).

My top 3 priorities are to make West Mercia Police

More trusted – by listening to local people and making policing much more responsive to the priorities of local communities;


More effective – by prioritising crime prevention and tackling issues that put people at risk of offending;


More efficient – by better use of technology and partnership working.

West Mercia has been rated as one of the five worst performing police forces in the country. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary found that the force “requires improvement at keeping people safe and reducing crime.”
Violent crime, sexual offences and robbery have all risen sharply in the last year.
Local people are being let down by under-investment and a lack of strong leadership.
We deserve better. To get that, we need a new approach.
As your next Police and Crime Commissioner I would demand immediate improvements to cut crime and prevent re-offending.
I will ensure the police work more closely with local communities, meeting local needs and tackling local priorities.
My 20 years experience as an elected councillor mean I have the skills of listening to members of the community, championing your views and where possible achieving your priorities.
I have lived in Worcestershire for 25 years and until recently was employed as a senior manager in the NHS. I have built up a wealth of local knowledge and experience of service management in the public sector.
It is time for us to have a Commissioner who will listen to local residents and act to keep them safe. 
With your support on May 5th, that’s exactly what I will do.

Politics must not be allowed to interfere as it brings a narrow agenda that could damage the front line of policing that we all rely on and need to have trust in.
Since November 2012 I have worked for the people of West Mercia as your Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner and have a track record that is proven and open to scrutiny. Those I have worked with and the thousands I have met publicly know that I am committed to strengthen our police services, to get the best deal for victims of crime, use early intervention and education to reduce offending, and ensure that people and communities take priority.
I have played a strategic role in protecting front line policing and bolstered police numbers in West Mercia, while nationally numbers have dropped. I am proud that confidence in our West Mercia police force is above the national average and is rising. Victim services, key policing partnerships and local policing have all been strengthened and I, as part of a leadership team have been driving forward significant change to transform our policing services.
Our West Mercia police force is currently in an excellent financial position due to prudent and careful management and plans are already in place to meet new financial challenges that will require both stability and continuity.
I have demonstrated the ability to lead, have credibility in the role, and can be trusted as a safe pair of hands to provide the continuity required to reform policing and enhance the delivery of policing services.
On May 5th I provide an option for you to vote for a truly INDEPENDENT candidate who has no allegiance to any political party.

Demand the government gives the police the funds they need
The Tories claim they have protected the Police Service. This is just not true. West Mercia is one of the poorest funded Police areas in the country. The government is cutting the budget by £600,000 taking officers off the beat.
I will not be complicit with the Tory councils across West Mercia in cutting police services.
Put victims first
Victims must be confident that when they report a crime it will be investigated. Over the last five years police numbers across West Mercia have dropped by 18% and half the PCSOs have gone.
Prioritise domestic violence, anti-social behaviour, and hate crime
Reports of domestic violence across West Mercia have increased by a staggering 66%. Fewer Police and PCSOs on the beat will see an increase in anti-social behaviour and hate crimes.
Encourage the police to work with other agencies
The Police must have the resources to work with other agencies which protect people. Social workers, schools, faith communities and voluntary organisations all have their part to play. Working together takes time but these crucial relationships must be at the centre of the Police’s work in West Mercia.
Educate the public about online crime and abuse 
Criminals will seek out every opportunity to find victims and vulnerable people for online scams or online abuse. The police have an important role in educating people to stay safe online.
Vote for a Labour Police and Crime Commissioner in West Mercia and I promise I will work to deliver these priorities for you.

The nature of crime in the UK is constantly changing, it is essential a PCC can “think out of the box” and keep abreast of new technologies and develop approaches to improve policing.
I will give 100% commitment to the role to ensure the necessary accountability at all levels of policing, its operational focus and delivery, and its management and record on financial performance.
My personal guarantee to everyone who lives and/or works in the West Midlands Police Area is that as your elected UKIP PCC I will work tirelessly to provide the key link between the West Midlands Public and its Police Force.

My pledges:

Drive down crime in all our communities.


Increase recruitment from 450 to 1000.


Equip our police with the best modern technology.


Protect Neighbourhood Policing and PCSOs.


Help build a successful West Midlands economy.

 
My central ambition is keeping the people of the West Midlands safe and secure by responding effectively to criminality and bringing offenders to justice.
I was born in the West Midlands and have lived here with my family for most of my life.
I qualified as a teacher at St Peter’s College, Birmingham and taught locally. I served as an MP from 1992 – 2005 and for eight years I was a government minister.
As a transport minister I worked closely with the police on road safety issues and introduced seizing of uninsured vehicles and the ban on handheld mobile phones whilst driving.
Neighbourhood policing lies at the core of keeping our communities safe. Residents need to know officers and PCSOs in their area. Working closely with local people our police can help create safe places to live, work and bring up our children.
The needs of victims will always be a top priority. I will continue my Victims Commission of experts which ensures victims get the help they need.
I want our police to have the latest technology to help them tackle crime in a rapidly changing world.
I will continue to recruit to our force by increasing new recruits from 450 to 1000. I will ensure we recruit the very best people and that they look more like the people of the West Midlands.

People should be confident he is listening to their concerns and making sure police priorities reflect that. If elected I’ll work with Government and local communities to that end.
My previous experience, serving five years on West Midlands Police Authority makes me well qualified to take on this important role. During that time I served as Chairman of Finance as well as Audit and Standards. Roles where I regularly had to hold the Chief Constable to account.
After leading a large Council, I have real experience of managing multi-million pound budgets and being accountable to local people. My 17 years in public service and the commitment to listen to the needs of the whole community mean I will bring a common sense approach and a lifetime of being a part of the community to bear in the role.

1.Protecting the frontline
I will work to increase frontline police resources to reduce victims of crime.
 
2. Improving policing through technology
Equipping officers with the latest technology, giving them the tools they need at their finger-tips. This will release hundreds of hours of extra policing in our community.
 
3. Use of resources
Police spending must focus on your priorities. Keeping police stations open, not refurbishing Police Headquarters. I will review all spending and prioritise the frontline, not support vanity projects.

I have served as West Yorkshire’s Police & Crime Commissioner since I was elected in 2012, I am standing to be re-elected on my record of delivery.
I am the only candidate in West Yorkshire with the proven ability and track record to stand up for people across West Yorkshire providing the strong committed leadership our police and communities need.
I made firm promises when I was elected to stand against the £140m Tory cut to the police in West Yorkshire and to protect frontline policing.
I have delivered and with partners have protected our local Police and Community Support Officers whilst also recruiting an extra 300 police officers to rebuild policing numbers in West Yorkshire.
I continue to fight for more Proceeds of Crime to come back to West Yorkshire and to invest more of this money to make sure our communities are safer and feel safer.
I am proud that my Safer Communities Fund has now provided £1.2m new funding to hundreds of local groups to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour and support victims.
I pledged to reduce the cost of my office in line with Government cuts to the police and I now have one of the lowest office costs in England & Wales.
My pledges to you:

Protect frontline policing 
Protect Police & Community Support Officers
Put more proceeds of crime back into our communities
Put victims, in particular the most vulnerable, first 
Fight for a fairer funding deal for West Yorkshire

I am one of the first to sign the Committee on Standards in Public Life checklist showing I am committed to openness, transparency and high ethical standards in public life. Making decisions in an open and transparent way, ensuring that members of the public have easy access to the PCC and that they are listened to so that the service delivered is of the highest quality. I am also committed to the eradication of fraud.
I also believe that the Chief Officer needs support so that he or she can be innovative and free to run the force without undue interference
Support for officers and support staff who can do the job knowing that those at the top will back them in their efforts and supply the best and latest equipment to make the job less hazardous where possible. It is after all a job like no other.

Tackling cyber-crime – Some of the most vulnerable victims in society are targeted using the internet. I will create a unit to prevent internet crime and to train officers to deal with cyber-crime more effectively.

Our Neighbourhood Policing Teams are the key to making us feel secure on our streets, but they are increasingly being undermined through poor support. Police vacancies remain unfilled while the frontline policing budget for our area has £3 million lying there unspent. Crime has reduced in many areas, but these neighbourhoods often then see their PCSOs reduced and sent elsewhere, risking crime going up once more. To make matters worse, the majority of crimes that are committed go unsolved, with the perpetrators free to offend again.
The entourage around the Police & Crime Commissioner costs over £1 million, and £26 million sits in the bank as reserves for a rainy day. It’s time to get more of this money spent: to get all our areas their fair share of community policing; introduce more No Cold Calling Zones to protect the vulnerable from fraud; to tackle hate crime and domestic violence head on; to deter more from offending in the first place by catching more of those that do.

However, priority must be given to traditional policing, where communities can be secure in the knowledge that the police actually serve the local community and have a visible presence, and can be on hand to address issues that matter to them, such as domestic burglary, anti-social behaviour and drug crime, which have gone largely unchallenged.
Yet, sometimes prevention is better than cure – and a special department with its own budget will be set up so that households can apply for a grant to make their homes more secure. 
I remain steadfast to challenging religious and cultural practices which place many women at the risk of serious harm, through forced marriages, domestic abuse and illegal divorces. So too, to the protection of each and every child in our community from child sexual exploitation or from institutions that masquerade as places of education but in reality indoctrinate and teach intolerance and to tackling political correctness which has led to 1,000’s of serious crimes swept under the carpet.
In a time of austerity, when many hundreds of families across the region rely on food banks and cannot afford to heat their homes, I pledge a third of my salary to go back directly into the community – elected officials can no longer place themselves above the ordinary person – for our communities to see real change – we really do have to “all be in it together”.

Angus Stuart Macpherson,https://1rbena1k2rviaenzl3kexmgl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Angus-Macpherson.jpg,The Conservative Party Candidate,https://1rbena1k2rviaenzl3kexmgl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Emblem1_BW.jpg,"It has been an honour to represent you as Police and Crime Commissioner for Wiltshire and Swindon for the past four years.  I have worked hard to reduce bureaucracy and the cost of policing whilst ensuring that all our resources go towards reducing crime and ensuring your safety.
My primary responsibility is to hold the Chief Constable to account for the service the Police provide. I monitor police performance weekly but an independent annual assessment is made by HM Inspector of Constabulary which graded Wiltshire Police “GOOD”.
I have spent much of my time as your PCC delivering value for money both from your police force and my management team.  My office and police panel cost less than the old Police Authority.  The Wiltshire policing precept is the lowest in the South West.
We have worked hard to put more officers out in their communities and this has been done by smarter working, better technology and a reduced rank structure.  In essence I am keen that our police spend their time chasing criminals and not efficiency targets.
Victim satisfaction has been maintained at above national average levels.  Wiltshire has also become a national leader in the implementation of witness and victim care programmes.
We face serious policing challenges ahead and I am determined to ensure that we get our fair share of increased police funding from the Home Office.  If re-elected I will continue to ensure that we see the benefits of regional police cooperation efficiencies in order to deliver better local policing in Wiltshire & Swindon.
I ask for your vote to RE-ELECT me on Thursday 5th May as the ONLY candidate with a track record of delivery in the PCC job.

They say “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, but something is broken. We have too many break-ins without convictions. Churchill Insurance say we have the worst rate of solving burglary and robbery in England and Wales. Almost 92 out of 100 such crimes go unpunished.
This is not good enough. No doubt the cut to local police numbers of 153 since 2010 helps these criminals. Too many burglaries are not investigated, victims not compensated and police are frustrated.
We need to change things and on 5th May your vote can help me do just that.
Our Police Men and Women, Police Community Support Officers and Special Constables want to make a difference and keep us safe. They need the numbers, equipment and resources to do this. Their morale is too low and stress too high, with too many good Officers leaving mid-career.
My five-point urgent action plan for a safer Wiltshire & Swindon

I will work to cut “management” and create more “coppers”, free to do their work in the best way they know how – out on the beat.
I want crime designed out of neighbourhoods. I want to rejuvenate Neighbourhood Watch and Farm Watch, making them central to happier, healthier communities, that look out for each other, with more “Street Pastors” keeping our town centres safe at night.
Drug laws need reform based on science, not political prejudice.
Criminals need to confront the impacts of their crimes through restorative justice with proceeds from their crimes returned to victims and communities that they wreck.
Prioritize cybercrime: protecting children, combating identity theft and fraud.

Let’s be tough on criminals, kind to victims and communities.

During my four year term as the Wiltshire Police & Crime Commissioner, I want Wiltshire Police to take the fight to the criminals, by increasing street policing and cutting bureaucracy and waste. I pledge to:

I have lived and worked in Wiltshire all my life, and served on the former Wiltshire Police Authority.
As Leader of Swindon BC I worked closely with the Police Authority and senior Constabulary’s Officers, also whilst as Chair of the Wiltshire Ambulance Service, as we sought closer working between the emergency services and the creation of a joint 999 call centre.
My Vision for Policing in Wiltshire:
Honesty, Integrity, Openness, and Transparency will be my guiding principles as Wiltshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner. I will hold the Chief Constable and the Wiltshire Constabulary to account, ensuing that the diverse needs and views of Wiltshire residents are fully represented.
As a Labour Police Commissioner I will:

Create an environment where people feel safe whether at home or out in their local community.


Seek to promote Neighbourhood Policing Teams to ensure that Wiltshire Police have a visible presence in every village or neighbourhood and Neighbourhood Policing Teams are seen as part of the local community.


Tackle Anti-Social Behaviour and perceived ASB activity. Like working with other agencies and community groups, to find alternative activities for our young people so hanging around on street corners is not their only outdoor recreational option.


Work with Councils and other public bodies to create opportunities to establish better more cost effect way of delivery services.


Create strong community links through the Wiltshire’s Area Boards, Parish Councils and Community groups, to enable a wider public input into the formulation of future Policing Plans.
